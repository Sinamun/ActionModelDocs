## How It Works: A Glimpse into the Future of Action

The Desktop App is fundamentally different from Large Language Models (LLMs) that only process and generate text. The Action Model is a **Large Action Model (LAM)**—it perceives and interacts with the world through a graphical user interface (GUI), just like a human.

At its core, the application:
1.  **Sees the Screen:** It captures pixels and analyzes the DOM/HTML structure of applications to understand the context of what's on your screen.
2.  **Controls the Inputs:** It takes direct control of your mouse and keyboard to navigate, click, type, and manipulate elements.
3.  **Thinks and Plans:** Using the LAM engine, it decides the next best action to achieve a given goal.

This approach allows it to operate *any* application on your computer—from web browsers and email clients to complex enterprise software like Salesforce or Adobe Photoshop—without needing any APIs.

<Tab title="Local Environment">
  When you run an agent on your own device, it takes full control of your computer's mouse and keyboard. This means that while an automation is running, you won't be able to use your computer for other tasks. It's like having a dedicated assistant using your machine.

  <Warning>
    You can only run one automation at a time on your local machine to avoid conflicts. This mode is ideal for training, testing, and running tasks that you can schedule during downtime.
  </Warning>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Cloud Environment (VPC)">
  For 24/7, uninterrupted automation, you can deploy agents in our Virtual Private Computer (VPC) cloud environment. Each agent gets its own dedicated virtual machine in the cloud that it controls.

  - **Run 24/7 in the background:** Your agents work tirelessly without interrupting you.
  - **Scale infinitely:** You can create and run as many agents as you need, each on its own cloud computer.
  - **Live Streaming:** You can securely stream a live view of an agent's desktop to monitor its work in real-time.

  This is the ultimate solution for businesses and power users who need to run complex, long-running automations in parallel.

## Training Your Assistant: Building a Digital Workforce

The true power of the Desktop App lies in its ability to learn and adapt. You can create specialized AI assistants for different roles within a team—Marketing, HR, Sales, Support, etc.—and train them to become experts in their respective domains.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create an Agent Persona">
  Start by defining a new assistant. Give it a name and assign it a role, like "Marketing Assistant" or "Sales Operations Bot." This helps organize its learned skills and memories. You can create a whole team of specialized agents.
</Step>

<Step title="Train Your Agent">
  An agent learns by observing. The more it sees, the more capable it becomes. There are two primary modes for training:

  <Tabs>
  <Tab title="Background Training">
    This is the passive, long-term learning method. You simply let the agent run in the background on your computer for weeks or months. It will quietly observe all your actions, identifying repetitive tasks, learning your habits, and automatically building a rich library of:

    - **Workflows:** Recognizing sequences of actions.
    - **Variables & Rules:** Understanding what makes a workflow dynamic.
    - **Schedules:** Noting when you typically perform certain tasks.
    - **Connections & Chains:** Mapping how different workflows relate to each other.
    - **Memories:** Internalizing your preferences, styles, and contextual knowledge.

    This method is designed to create a comprehensive "digital twin" that deeply understands how you work.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Manual Training">
    For specific, immediate tasks, you can use manual training. It's simple:
    1.  Click "Start Recording."
    2.  Perform the task you want to automate.
    3.  Click "Stop Recording."
    4.  Name the workflow and add any necessary variables or rules.

    This is perfect for quickly teaching the agent a new, well-defined process.

## Automation Building Blocks

Your automations are constructed from a few powerful, interconnected components. Understanding these building blocks is key to unlocking the full potential of your AI assistants.

### Workflows: The Lego Blocks of Automation

A workflow is a unique sequence of actions required to complete a single task, like "Send a welcome email to a new customer" or "Generate a weekly sales report." Think of them as reusable components or Lego blocks that you can use to build much larger, more complex automations (Chains).

Each workflow is more than just a simple recording; it's a smart procedure containing several key elements:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Variables">
  Variables make workflows dynamic. Instead of hardcoding a customer's name, you create a `customer_name` variable. This allows the same workflow to be used for any customer. Variables can be passed in when a workflow starts or extracted from the screen during execution.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Rules">
  Rules add logic and conditionality. For example, "IF the invoice amount is > $10,000, THEN add a 'manager_approval_required' tag." Rules allow a workflow to handle different scenarios and make decisions based on the data it encounters.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Ask Human (Confirmation Points)">
  For critical steps, you can insert an "Ask Human" checkpoint. The automation will pause and ask for your confirmation before proceeding. This is essential for tasks involving financial transactions or sending important communications.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Connections">
  Workflows can call other workflows. A "New Customer Onboarding" workflow might connect to a separate "Create CRM Record" workflow, promoting reusability and keeping your automations organized and modular.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Memories">
  Workflows tap into the agent's Memory to execute tasks with the right context. For example, it might remember "the user prefers to save reports in the 'Q4-Reports' Google Drive folder" and act accordingly without being explicitly told each time.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Chains: Orchestrating End-to-End Processes

While workflows handle individual tasks, Chains handle entire business processes. A Chain is a sequence of linked workflows that execute in a specific order to achieve a larger objective.

-   **Global Variables:** A Chain maintains its own set of global variables that can be accessed and modified by any workflow within it. For example, a `customer_id` generated in the first workflow ("Create CRM Record") can be used by all subsequent workflows in the chain.
-   **Complex Logic:** Chains support branching logic, loops, and error handling, allowing you to model sophisticated, real-world processes.
-   **Massive Scale:** By chaining workflows together, you can automate huge amounts of work that span multiple applications and take hours to complete manually. For instance, a "New Hire Onboarding" chain could involve workflows for HR, IT, and Finance systems.

### Memories: The AI's Second Brain

Being able to take actions is only the beginning. To effectively automate your work, the AI requires deep context about you, your habits, your style, and how you make decisions. This is the role of **Memories**.

Imagine hiring a new Executive Assistant. At first, they can only handle simple, explicit instructions like "book a meeting." But after shadowing you for months, they learn your preferences, anticipate your needs, and start acting as a true extension of you—drafting emails in your style, prioritizing tasks as you would, and making decisions on your behalf.

The Memory system is designed to replicate this learning process for your AI assistant. It builds a persistent, context-aware knowledge base from both passive observation and your direct input. Memories include:

-   **General Habits:** "User always checks email and Slack first thing in the morning."
-   **Platform-Specific Knowledge:** "In HubSpot, the 'MQL' lifecycle stage is always followed by an outreach sequence from the 'SDR' team." "The company's brand voice on Twitter is witty and informal."
-   **File Locations & Credentials:** Securely remembering where important files are stored in your cloud drive or the credentials needed to log into a specific platform.
-   **Strategic Context:** "When analyzing marketing campaigns, prioritize Click-Through Rate over raw impression numbers."

This "second brain" is the secret sauce that allows the LAM to move beyond robotic execution and perform tasks with nuance, personalization, and human-like intelligence.

### Schedules: Your 24/7 Digital Workforce

With your workflows and chains built, you can put your AI workforce on the clock. The scheduling system allows you to trigger any automation at any time.

-   **Flexible Cadence:** Run tasks on a recurring basis—daily, weekly, monthly—or at a specific date and time.
-   **Always On:** Your agents can work around the clock, processing data, sending reports, and managing systems while you sleep.
-   **Visual Calendar:** Manage your automation schedule through an intuitive, visual interface that looks and feels like Google Calendar. See what's planned, what's running, and what's completed at a glance.
-   **Full Transparency:** Click on any completed task in the calendar to review its performance. You can watch a full video replay of the work it completed, inspect its logs, and read any notes or outputs it generated.

## Speaking to the Action Model

The Desktop App features a powerful conversational interface that allows you to interact with your assistant using natural language.

-   **Give Instructions:** Simply tell your agent what to do: "Find the latest sales report and email it to the management team."
-   **Get Asked Questions:** The LAM will proactively ask for clarification or confirmation when it encounters an "Ask Human" step or faces ambiguity.
-   **Initiate Workflows:** You can trigger any saved workflow or chain directly from the chat by typing `@<name_of_automation>` or by describing the task you want it to perform.
-   **Real-Time Action Log:** The chatbox provides a live, step-by-step feed of every action the agent is taking, giving you complete transparency and control.

## What's Behind the Desktop App?

The sleek interface of the Desktop App is powered by a sophisticated engine that combines our core API, a token-based economy, and a sustainable business model.

### The LAM API Engine

Every action your assistant takes is a call to the **Action Model API**. The process is a continuous, recursive loop:

1.  **Look:** The agent captures the current state of the screen (screenshots, DOM, etc.).
2.  **Plan:** This state information, along with the overall goal, is sent to the LAM API, which determines the single best next action.
3.  **Act:** The agent executes the action returned by the API (e.g., "click button with ID 'submit-form'").
4.  The loop repeats until the task is complete.

<Note>
Under the hood, every action consumes **$LAM token**. You can read more about this on our [API page](/productstechnology/API).
</Note>

### The Circular Economy

This system creates a powerful, self-sustaining circular economy.

-   **Business Model:** Businesses can subscribe to use the platform, paying in traditional FIAT currency (£, $, €). These payments are converted into credits for running automations.
-   **LAM Token Utility:** If you hold your own $LAM tokens (for instance, by earning them through data contributions), you can add them to the app to pay for actions at a significant discount.
-   **The Flywheel:**
    1.  The community trains the Action Model by contributing data and earns $LAM tokens as a reward.
    2.  Businesses and users need credits (backed by $LAM tokens) to use the powerful, trained Action Model.
    3.  This demand for tokens creates value, which further incentivizes community members to contribute high-quality training data, making the model even better.
