The Action Model Browser Extension is the primary tool that empowers our community to train the world's first Large Action Model (LAM). By simply installing the extension and browsing the web, you contribute valuable interaction data that teaches the LAM how to perform tasks, navigate interfaces, and automate workflows just like a human.

This is the engine of our community-owned AI. Every click, every form submission, and every navigation you record helps build the **Action Tree**, our proprietary map of the interactive internet. In return for your contribution, you earn points that will convert to `$LAM` tokens, making you a true owner of the platform you're helping to build.

## How the Extension Works

The Action Model extension is more than just a data recorder; it's your command center for training the LAM, tracking your rewards, and managing your privacy.

### Seamless Integration with Your Dashboard
The browser extension is designed to work in perfect sync with your main Action Model dashboard at **train.actionmodel.com**. As long as you are logged into your account on the website, the extension will automatically be logged in and ready to go. This creates a unified and seamless experience, allowing you to manage your account, view detailed analytics, and access advanced features from the web app, while the extension handles the data collection in your browser.

### Understanding the Interface

The extension's interface is designed to be intuitive and informative, giving you full visibility and control over your training activities.

-   **Home Dashboard:** This is your main hub. Here you can see your total points, your current reward tier, your referral code, and key statistics like the total number of trainings, hours contributed, and actions recorded. The prominent **Start Training** button is your gateway to contributing.
-   **Active Training View:** When a training session is active, the view changes to show a running timer and a live feed of the actions being recorded. You have the controls to **Pause** or **Finish** the session at any time, giving you complete authority over the recording process.

    <Frame caption="During a session, you can monitor the elapsed time and recorded actions.">

    </Frame>

-   **Session Summary:** After you finish a training session, the extension displays a summary, including the total duration and the number of actions recorded. Your earned points will enter a "Calculating" state as our system processes the data, verifies its quality, and applies any relevant multipliers.

    <Frame caption="A summary appears after each session, with points pending calculation.">

    </Frame>
-   **History:** The History tab provides a complete log of all your past training sessions, both Background and Custom. You can see the date, duration, and the final points awarded for each session, allowing you to track your contribution history over time.

    <Frame caption="The History tab keeps a detailed record of all your training sessions.">

### The Two Modes of Training

The extension offers two distinct training modes, catering to different types of users and data contribution goals.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
    <Card title="Passive Background Training" icon="person-running" href="/trainingthelam/BackgroundWorkflowTraining">
        <p>This is the simplest way to contribute. In this "set it and forget it" mode, the extension passively records your everyday browsing activity. It's designed for high-volume, broad-spectrum data collection that forms the foundational layer of the Action Tree. This mode is perfect for all users who want to earn rewards with minimal effort.</p>
        <p>Your natural, day-to-day interactions provide the LAM with a diverse dataset, teaching it how people typically navigate websites, what common paths they take, and how different sites are structured.</p>
    </Card>
    <Card title="Active Custom Agent Training" icon="wand-magic-sparkles" href="/dashboard/CustomAgent">
        <p>This is a high-impact mode for power users who want to maximize their rewards and contribute high-fidelity data. When you train a Custom Web Agent, you are actively recording a specific, structured workflow from start to finish. For example, "Post a product to Shopify" or "Find a flight on Kayak and add it to a spreadsheet."</p>
        <p>Because this data is labeled and structured, it's incredibly valuable for teaching the LAM complex, multi-step tasks. In recognition of this value, completing these custom trainings and bounties can earn you up to **100x more points** than background training.</p>

### Bounties and Multipliers

To steer community efforts toward commercially valuable and highly sought-after automations, we've implemented a system of bounties and multipliers. Certain high-value websites and platforms, such as AWS, Stripe, or major SaaS applications, have point multipliers. Training on these sites earns you significantly more rewards, as the data is critical for developing enterprise-grade agents.

You can view available website multipliers in the **Bounties** section of the extension.

<Frame caption="The Bounties page shows website-specific multipliers to boost your earnings.">

## Training Journeys: Building the Global Action Tree

Every time you run a training session, you are doing more than just earning points—you are contributing a "journey" to the **Action Tree**. Think of the internet as a vast, uncharted territory. The Action Tree is the master map of this territory, and each user journey is a new path or road drawn onto it.

When you search for a product on Amazon, that becomes a path. When you book a hotel on Booking.com, that adds another branch. When you process an invoice in Stripe, you're mapping a critical commercial highway. By combining millions of these journeys from our community, we create an unprecedented, interconnected map of possible actions and workflows across the entire digital world.

But the Action Tree is more than just a series of steps; it's a rich, visual blueprint. Because the Action Model is fundamentally visual, it needs to know precisely *where* to click on the screen. Your training sessions capture this critical spatial data. They teach the model not only the logical path of a workflow but also the exact visual characteristics of the elements you interact with—the appearance of a button, its position on the page (like its x, y coordinates), and its context within the user interface. This level of detail is what enables the LAM to interact with websites with surgical precision, dramatically improving its accuracy when it needs to replicate those actions in the future.

This proprietary data structure is what gives the Large Action Model its power. Unlike LLMs that can only *describe* how to do something, the LAM can actually *do* it by following the paths laid out in the Action Tree.

## Your Security and Privacy are Paramount

We understand that granting access to your browsing activity requires immense trust. We have engineered the Action Model extension with a privacy-first and security-by-design approach to ensure your data is safe and you are always in control.

### What We Record (and What We Don't)

To train the model effectively, we need to capture the context of your actions. The extension requests permission to record the following:

<Frame caption="The extension clearly outlines what data is recorded and how your privacy is protected.">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56f7481f-fce7-40b9-8e42-7a70188b2a8a" alt="Permission request screen detailing what will be recorded and the privacy protections in place." />
</Frame>

-   **Clicks and Interactions:** The specific elements you click on (e.g., `button with id="login"`).
-   **Form Inputs:** The data you type into forms. **Crucially, all password fields (`<input type="password">`) and fields identified as containing sensitive financial information are automatically obfuscated on your computer *before* the data ever leaves your browser.**
-   **Navigation:** The URLs you visit.
-   **Screenshots:** Visual context of the page. Our system is trained to automatically detect and **blur common forms of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** such as names, addresses, and phone numbers from these screenshots.

<Warning>
While our automated systems for masking and blurring sensitive data are robust, we recommend that you use the website blocklist feature for any sites you consider highly sensitive, such as online banking portals.
</Warning>

### You Are in Control

Your privacy and comfort are our priority. The extension provides you with granular controls to manage your data contribution. In the settings menu, you can:

-   **Enable/Disable Screenshots:** If you are not comfortable with screenshot recording, you can disable it with a single toggle. The model will continue to train on interaction data without the visual context.
-   **Manage Website Permissions:** You have full control over which websites the extension can operate on. You can easily add any site to a blocklist to prevent any data recording on that domain.
-   **Revoke Permissions:** You can revoke all permissions for the extension at any time through your browser's native extension management settings.

<Frame caption="The settings menu gives you granular control over screenshots and site-specific training.">
