## How It Works: Converting Actions into Value

The Browser Extension operates as a lightweight observer that sits in your browser, capturing interactions and converting them into training data for the Large Action Model. Unlike traditional data collection tools, every action you take directly contributes to teaching the AI how to navigate and interact with the webâ€”and you get rewarded for it.

The extension works through three core principles:
1. **Passive Learning:** Records your natural browsing patterns in the background
2. **Active Training:** Allows you to complete specific bounties for bonus rewards
3. **Privacy-First:** You control what gets recorded with comprehensive block lists and settings

## Getting Started

<Step title="Install the Extension">
  Download and install the Action Model Browser Extension from your browser's extension store. The extension is available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Brave browsers.

## Training Modes

The Browser Extension offers multiple ways to contribute training data and earn rewards:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Background Training">
  ### Passive Earning While You Browse
  
  Background training is the easiest way to earn $LAM tokens. Simply activate it and continue your normal browsing activities. The extension will:
  
  - Record your interactions with websites automatically
  - Learn from your navigation patterns
  - Build understanding of common user workflows
  - Generate points based on the quality and uniqueness of data
  
  **Points Earned:** 10-50 $LAM per hour of active browsing

<Tab title="Custom Agent Training">

## Best Practices for Maximum Earnings

<Steps>
<Step title="Diversify Your Training">
  Don't just stick to one website or workflow type. The LAM values diverse data, so explore different sites and tasks to maximize your contributions.
</Step>

<Step title="Complete Daily Bounties">
  Check for new bounties each day. They offer the highest point multipliers and help train the LAM on priority tasks.
</Step>

<Step title="Build Your Referral Network">
  Each person you refer adds to your multiplier. A strong network can significantly boost your earnings over time.
</Step>

<Step title="Maintain Training Streaks">
  Consecutive days of training unlock streak bonuses. Even 10 minutes of daily training maintains your streak.
</Step>

<Step title="Focus on Quality">
  Complete workflows fully and accurately. Half-finished or erratic recordings earn fewer points than clean, complete demonstrations.
</Step>
</Steps>
