<Info>
  The Action Model API enables developers to integrate LAM (Large Action Model) capabilities directly into their applications, providing precise GUI automation instructions based on context and goals.
</Info>

## Overview

The Action Model API fundamentally differs from traditional LLM APIs by providing **deterministic next-action instructions** for GUI automation rather than text predictions. It leverages the proprietary Action Tree to deliver precise, context-aware automation instructions.

<Card title="Key Differentiators" icon="sparkles">
  - **Action-based outputs** instead of text generation
  - **GUI interaction instructions** with exact coordinates and elements
  - **Pre-mapped action paths** from the Action Tree database
  - **Context-aware execution** based on screenshots and DOM analysis
</Card>

## How It Works

The API operates on an action loop principle, continuously analyzing the current state and determining the next optimal action:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Send Context">
    Provide the current environment state including:
    - Goal or task description
    - Historical actions taken
    - Current screenshot
    - HTML/DOM structure
    - Any relevant memories or context
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Receive Action">
    API returns the precise next GUI action:
    - Element to interact with (XPath, CSS selector, or coordinates)
    - Action type (click, type, scroll, hover, etc.)
    - Any required parameters (text to type, scroll distance, etc.)
    - Confidence score based on Action Tree mapping
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Execute &amp; Loop">
    Your application executes the action and sends the updated state back to the API for the next instruction, continuing until task completion
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Token Consumption &amp; Pricing

<Note>
  Each API call consumes $LAM tokens based on the complexity of the action and the model version used.
</Note>

### Pricing Model

| Model Version | Cost per Action | Use Case |
|--------------|-----------------|----------|
| LAM-1 Basic | 10 $LAM tokens | Simple navigation and form filling |
| LAM-2 Advanced | 25 $LAM tokens | Complex multi-step workflows |
| LAM-3 Enterprise | 50 $LAM tokens | High-accuracy critical operations |

### Token Management

- **Pre-purchase tokens** through the dashboard
- **Automatic top-up** options available
- **Usage analytics** and cost tracking
- **Volume discounts** for enterprise customers

## Authentication

<Warning>
  Always keep your API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code.
</Warning>

### API Key Generation

1. Log into the [Action Model Dashboard](https://train.actionmodel.com)
2. Navigate to API Settings
3. Generate a new API key
4. Store securely in environment variables
