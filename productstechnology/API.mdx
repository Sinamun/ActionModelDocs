## Overview

The Action Model API fundamentally differs from traditional LLM APIs by providing **deterministic next-action instructions** for GUI automation rather than text predictions. Instead of generating text responses, our API analyzes screenshots, DOM structures, and context to return precise GUI actions like clicks, typing, and navigation.

## How It Works

The API operates on an action loop principle. You send the current state (goal, screenshot, HTML/DOM, history), and the API returns the exact next action to perform. This includes the specific element to interact with (via XPath, CSS selector, or coordinates), the action type (click, type, scroll), and any required parameters. Your application executes this action and sends the updated state back for the next instruction, continuing until task completion.

## Integration &amp; Pricing

Developers can integrate via our REST API, pre-built SDKs (Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, .NET), or cloud VM environments for parallel agent execution. Each API call consumes $LAM tokens based on model complexity - ranging from 10 tokens for basic navigation (LAM-1) to 50 tokens for enterprise-critical operations (LAM-3). 

The API leverages our proprietary Action Tree, a pre-mapped database of internet interactions, to deliver highly accurate automation instructions. This makes it ideal for customer service automation, data extraction from sites without APIs, automated testing, and cross-platform process automation where traditional API integrations aren't available.

## Getting Started

To begin, create an account at [train.actionmodel.com](https://train.actionmodel.com), purchase $LAM tokens, generate your API key, and choose your preferred integration method. Full documentation and support are available at [docs.actionmodel.com/api](https://docs.actionmodel.com/api).
