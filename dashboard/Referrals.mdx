## The Revolutionary 3-Layer Referral System

Our multi-level referral structure creates a powerful network effect that rewards you for building a thriving community:

<Tab title="How It Works">
### Your Referral Network

The system tracks three layers of connections from your original invitation:

- **Layer 1 (L1)**: People you directly invite using your unique referral link
- **Layer 2 (L2)**: People invited by your Layer 1 referrals
- **Layer 3 (L3)**: People invited by your Layer 2 referrals

<Note>
You earn ongoing rewards from the activities of your entire 3-layer network, creating passive income potential that grows with your community.
</Note>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Network Growth Example">
### The Multiplication Effect

Let's see how your network can grow exponentially:

<Steps>
<Step title="You invite 10 people">
  Your direct referrals (Layer 1) = **10 users**
</Step>

<Step title="Each invites 5 people">
  Your Layer 2 network = 10 × 5 = **50 users**
</Step>

<Step title="Each L2 invites 5 people">
  Your Layer 3 network = 50 × 5 = **250 users**
</Step>

<Step title="Total Network Impact">
  You now earn from **310 users** in your network!
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Top performers with larger initial networks can build communities of **31,000+ users**, creating substantial ongoing reward potential.

This isn't just about individual rewards—it's about building a sustainable, community-owned economy that benefits everyone.

The referral system creates a self-reinforcing economic flywheel:

<Steps>
<Step title="Community Growth">
  Your referrals expand the Action Model community, bringing in more trainers, advocates, and potential customers.
</Step>

<Step title="Enhanced Training">
  More users = more training data = better Action Model performance = more valuable product.
</Step>

<Step title="B2B Advocacy">
  Community members become natural evangelists, introducing Action Model to businesses they work with or know.
</Step>

<Step title="Revenue Generation">
  Businesses pay $1,000-$2,000/month for Action Model agents, generating substantial B2B revenue.
</Step>

<Step title="Token Buyback &amp; Burn">
  B2B revenue is used to buy back and burn $LAM tokens, reducing supply and increasing value for all holders.
</Step>

<Step title="Community Rewards">
  Higher token value benefits everyone in the community, especially active referrers with large networks.
</Step>
</Steps>

The Action Model referral system is designed to create sustainable, long-term value for the community. Unlike pyramid schemes, our model is backed by real utility (AI automation services), genuine product development (the LAM), and a revenue-generating business model (B2B subscriptions) that directly benefits token holders through the buyback mechanism.
