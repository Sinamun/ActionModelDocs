## What are Bounties?

Bounties are time‑limited, high‑priority tasks that direct training toward the most valuable workflows. They pay significantly more than standard training by combining base points with site‑specific multipliers and your personal bonuses. Expect tasks ranging from targeted data collection to end‑to‑end workflow creation.

## Rewards and Multipliers

- **Base bounty points:** 1,000–5,000 points per task (difficulty‑scaled)
- **Site/partner multipliers:** 2x–73x depending on priority and sponsorship
- **Personal multipliers:**
  - Referral network bonus: 5–25%
  - Streak bonuses for consecutive days
  - Quality bonuses for high‑value, unique data
  - Epoch specials as announced
- **Leaderboard bonuses (end of epoch):**
  - Top 1%: 10x  
  - Top 5%: 5x  
  - Top 10%: 3x  
  - Top 25%: 2x

<Info>
Epochs are 30‑day periods where points are tallied and rewards are distributed. Base bounty points post on validation; certain multipliers and leaderboard bonuses apply at epoch close.
</Info>

**Example:** 2,000 base × 10x site × 1.25 referral × 2x leaderboard = **50,000 points**.

## My Bounties

## Fair Play & Quality Rules

<Warning>
  Violations may lead to forfeited rewards, strikes, or account suspension. We actively monitor for:
  
  - Duplicate or replayed sessions
  - Automated/scripted inputs masquerading as human training
  - Off‑domain or irrelevant actions
  - Fabricated artifacts or tampered evidence
</Warning>

<Note>
  Keep submissions high signal: minimize back‑and‑forth, avoid redundant clicks, and prefer successful, goal‑directed sequences.
</Note>


## Strategy Tips

<Tip>
Maximize earnings by stacking: high‑multiplier sites → consistent daily streaks → quality/uniqueness → referral network bonus. Start early in each epoch to climb leaderboards.
</Tip>

- **Pick your niche:** Focus on domains and workflows you know well for faster, higher‑quality runs.
- **Read the spec twice:** Most rejections are from missed acceptance criteria.
- **Batch work:** Queue similar bounties to reuse mental context and speed.
- **Chase events:** Event bounties often carry temporary multipliers.
