## Big Tech Owns 99% of the AI future {#big-tech-owns-99%-of-the-ai-future}

- deep tech  
- Significantly more complicated than making Language Models (LLMs)  
- There is a much deeper moat in creating Action Models  
- The data requirements for a Large Action Model is significantly harder to attain  
  - Link to section [Training data required](#training-data-required)  
- This reduces the number of participants or competitors in this space.

## Action Model is the Uprising {#action-model-is-the-uprising}

- We believe that it should be owned by all of us  
- By contributing to the platform

- DAO  
  - Tokens run the DAO  
  - You will have part of the AI future  
- Utility  
  - Tokens are the central fuel and utility in the AI  
  - These tokens are consumed when anyone uses the Action Model  
  - Therefore, these tokens have an inherent value.

- Find mechanism to score creators and workflow publishers  
- Creators will have a reputation score  
- Based on: workflows used, tokens consumed  
- Token efficiency score  
  - This is a moving average ratio calculated based on the success of a workflow and the number of tokens consumed by a workflow.   
  - The higher the count of successful workflows, compared to the number of tokens will create a score  
- 

## Workflow Creation Guidelines {#workflow-creation-guidelines}

## Revenue Generation {#revenue-generation}

- a percentage of the consumed tokens from workflow usage is returned to the creator of the workflow or agent  
- This is in addition to the tokens that are burnt via action token consumption

Terminology: [https://chatgpt.com/share/68aca8c1-8a50-8013-8245-365590f7ef53](https://chatgpt.com/share/68aca8c1-8a50-8013-8245-365590f7ef53)

## Token Utility ($LAM) (tokenomics/TokenOverview.mdx) {#token-utility-($lam)-(tokenomics/tokenoverview.mdx)}

- Cost Per Action (tokenomics/CostPerAction.mdx)  
- Marketplace payments

Each action the agent does consumes tokens. 

The action loop:  
1\. pass environment (history, context, goals, memories, screenshot of the screen)  
2\. Call Large Action Model and the Action Tree to determine the next Action  
3\. Next Action is executed  
Return to step 1

This happens on a loop until the workflow is deemed to be complete.

Each of these action loops consumes tokens.

The LAM model costs a predetermined amount. 

E.g LAM1 will be $0.1 per action.

If the LAM token is $0.01 each, then an action costs 10 tokens. 

Some of these tokens are burnt, some are distributed to the workflow creators.
