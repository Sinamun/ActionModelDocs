For artificial intelligence to achieve full automation, it must be able to replicate the full spectrum of human digital capabilities. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have mastered text, they can't *act*. They exist in a world of words, separate from the interactive, visual environment where real work gets done.

Agents built on APIs are a step forward, but they are fundamentally limited. APIs expose less than 1% of the functionality available on the internet and within most applications. They are a developer's tool, not a user's reality.

### The Two Paths to Automation

This leaves us at a crossroads, with two possible futures for AI automation. Which path is more plausible?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Path A: The API-First Dream" icon="code">
    In this future, the entire internet, along with every desktop and mobile application, would need to be rebuilt from the ground up. Developers would have to create and maintain comprehensive APIs that cover every single feature and workflow a user can perform. **This is a multi-decade, trillion-dollar undertaking that will likely never happen.**
  </Card>
  <Card title="Path B: The GUI-Native Reality" icon="robot">
    In this far more likely future, an AI system learns to use the world's existing digital infrastructure exactly as it is today. It learns to see, understand, and interact with the same Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) that were designed for humans.  **This is the future Action Model is building.**

<Info>
The answer is clear. The fastest and most effective path to true automation is not to rebuild the world for machines, but to teach machines how to operate in the world built for humans.

## The Inevitable Leap: Large Action Models (LAMs)

A **Large Action Model (LAM)** is the evolutionary leap that makes this possible. Unlike an LLM, which processes language, a LAM is trained on a diet of human actions: clicks, scrolls, keyboard inputs, and complex workflows across countless applications. It learns the *how*, *what*, and *why* of digital tasks.

Action Model has already built the foundational technology to train this AI. By observing real user workflows, we are building the proprietary **Action Tree**â€”a comprehensive map of digital work. This allows the LAM to:

<Accordion title="Learn Your Workflows">
The AI observes and learns the exact sequence of steps you take to complete your daily tasks, from sending an email to managing a complex project.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Understand Context">
It pieces together the different tasks you perform, understanding the context and how they connect to achieve a larger goal.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Execute Autonomously">
Once trained, the LAM can execute these workflows on your behalf, acting as a true digital employee that operates seamlessly across all your apps and platforms.

The future of AI isn't just about conversation; it's about capability. With Action Model, we can build and own that future together.
