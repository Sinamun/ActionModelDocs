## Your Future Is Being Written Right Now

In the next 5 years, AI will fundamentally reshape every aspect of work, wealth, and society. The question isn't whether you'll be affected—it's whether you'll be a victim or a beneficiary of this transformation.

**This page is your roadmap to being part of the AI future, not a casualty of it.**

<Warning>

**The Stark Reality**: If you do nothing, you will be displaced. If you act now, you can be an owner. The window to choose is measured in months, not years.

</Warning>

## The Three Paths Forward

### Choose Your Destiny

## Income Replacement Strategy

### How to Replace Your Salary with AI Ownership

<Info>

**The Math**: If your job pays $60,000/year and will be automated in 3 years, you need to build $180,000 in value. Here's how Action Model makes that possible.

</Info>

### The Replacement Formula

| Current Income | Daily Training Hours | Workflows Created | Referrals Needed | Time to Replace |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| $30,000/year | 2-3 hours | 5-10 | 20-30 | 12-18 months |
| $60,000/year | 4-5 hours | 10-20 | 50-75 | 18-24 months |
| $100,000/year | 6-8 hours | 20-30 | 100-150 | 24-36 months |
| $150,000+/year | 8+ hours | 30-50 | 200+ | 36-48 months |

<Note>

**Early Advantage**: These timelines assume starting TODAY. Every month you wait, add 3-6 months to the timeline as competition increases.

</Note>

## Overcoming Common Objections

### Why People Hesitate (And Why They're Wrong)

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='"I don\'t have time"'>

**Reality Check**: You don't have time NOT to do this.

- Passive training requires zero additional time
- Your job will be automated whether you participate or not
- 2 hours today or unemployment tomorrow—your choice
- The time you spend scrolling social media could secure your future

**Solution**: Start with just passive training while you browse normally

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='"I\'m not technical"'>

**Reality Check**: Perfect! Most valuable training comes from non-technical users.

- The LAM needs to learn from regular people, not just developers
- Your everyday workflows are incredibly valuable
- Non-technical roles are being automated first (more urgency)
- The interface is designed for everyone

**Solution**: Your lack of technical skills is actually an advantage

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='"Sounds too good to be true"'>

**Reality Check**: The only thing "too good to be true" is thinking your job is safe.

- Big Tech is already doing this—just keeping all the value
- The economics are proven (see tokenomics)
- Early internet, Bitcoin, and Uber all sounded "too good to be true"
- The risk is in NOT participating, not in joining

**Solution**: Start small, verify for yourself, then scale up

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='"I\'ll wait and see"'>

**Reality Check**: By the time you "see," it'll be too late.

- Network effects mean early participants win
- Every day you wait, thousands join ahead of you
- The opportunity decreases exponentially over time
- "Wait and see" = "wait and lose"

**Solution**: Start with minimal commitment and increase as you see results

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
