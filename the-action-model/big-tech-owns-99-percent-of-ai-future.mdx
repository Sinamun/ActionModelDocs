## The Deep Tech Reality

### Why LAMs Are Infinitely Harder Than LLMs

<Warning>

**Deep Tech Truth**: This technology is very hard to train. The data requirements for a Large Action Model are significantly harder to attain than an LLM, creating an even deeper moat that only Big Tech can cross.

</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Training Data Scarcity">

### LAMs vs LLMs: A Completely Different Game

Unlike Language Models (LLMs) where training data can simply be downloaded from the internet:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="LLMs: Text Everywhere" icon="book">

- Books & journals freely available
- Scientific papers downloadable
- Billions of web articles
- Social media posts
- Wikipedia & forums
- **Cost**: Nearly free to acquire

</Card>

<Card title="LAMs: Path Data Required" icon="route">

- GUI interaction recordings needed
- Human actions must be captured
- Screen states tracked in sequence
- Decision contexts preserved
- Task completions mapped
- **Cost**: Expensive to collect

</Card>
</CardGroup>

### What is Path Data?

<Info>

**Path data** is the sequential recording of human-computer interactions that show HOW tasks are completed, not just what the end result looks like.

</Info>

Path data captures **five critical elements**:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Screenshots" icon="camera">

Visual state of the screen at each step, showing buttons, forms, menus, and content as they appear to users

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Actions" icon="hand-pointer">

Every mouse click, keyboard input, scroll, drag, hover, and navigation choice made by the user

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Context" icon="bullseye">

The goal being achieved and why specific actions are taken at each decision point

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Sequences" icon="list-ol">

The exact order and timing of actions, including pauses, corrections, and alternative paths

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Decision Points" icon="code-branch">

Why certain paths were chosen over others, what errors were avoided, how problems were solved

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Check>

**Critical Difference**: An LLM learns from reading about driving. A LAM needs to watch millions of hours of actual driving, seeing every turn of the wheel, every brake application, every navigation decision.

</Check>

### The Collection Challenge

Large Action Models need path data to train, but this doesn't exist organically to be scraped. It must be:

- **Deliberately recorded** - Requires active user participation
- **Properly labeled** - Needs context about what's being done
- **Sequentially organized** - Must maintain temporal relationships
- **Context-preserved** - Requires understanding of user intent

**Result**: Training data is extremely scarce, giving massive advantage to those who can collect it. The Action Model community can collect this together.

<Tab title="Complexity Multiplier">

**Action Models Are Significantly More Complicated Than Language Models**

The technical challenges compound:
- **Visual understanding**: Processing screenshots and UI elements
- **Temporal sequencing**: Understanding action order and timing
- **Context preservation**: Maintaining state across interactions
- **Error handling**: Managing failed actions and recovery
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Working across different OS and applications

This creates a much deeper moat in creating Action Models, reducing the number of participants or competitors in this space.

## The Data Exploitation Crisis

### Your Data, Their Profit

<Warning>

**The Ultimate Betrayal**: Your data is being taken to train all of this, and you aren't given any share of it. Every click, every search, every document you create, they're using it to build the AI that will replace you.

</Warning>

Think about it:
- **You provide the data** through years of using their platforms
- **They train the AI** using your behavioral patterns
- **They sell the AI** that replaces your job
- **You pay them** to use the AI that you helped create

**We believe that AI should be owned by the people who contribute to it.** This is why Action Model exists.

## How They Built the Walls

### The Monopolization Playbook

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Step 1: Data Hoarding">

**They Own Your Digital Life**

- **Google**: 8.5 billion searches daily = training data
- **Meta**: 3 billion users' social graphs = behavioral data  
- **Microsoft**: Every Office document = enterprise knowledge
- **Amazon**: 300 million customers = purchase patterns
- **Apple**: 2 billion devices = personal usage data

**Result**: Insurmountable data advantage for training AI models

</Tab>
<Tab title="Step 2: Compute Domination">

**They Control the Infrastructure**

- **90% of AI training** happens on Big Tech's infrastructure
- **GPUs cost millions** - only they can afford them at scale
- **Cloud monopoly** - AWS, Azure, GCP control 65% of cloud
- **Vertical integration** - designing custom AI chips (TPUs, etc.)

**Result**: Physical barriers preventing competition

</Tab>
<Tab title="Step 3: Talent Capture">

**They Buy Every Brain**

- **&#36;500K-&#36;1M salaries** for AI researchers
- **Acqui-hiring** - buying startups just for talent
- **Academic capture** - funding university labs
- **Golden handcuffs** - equity that locks in talent

**Result**: Brain drain from public/open development

</Tab>
<Tab title="Step 4: Regulatory Capture">

**They Write the Rules**

- **Lobbying armies** - spending &#36;100M+ annually
- **"AI Safety" narrative** - regulations that favor incumbents
- **Compliance costs** - rules only big companies can afford
- **Patent walls** - thousands of AI patents as weapons

**Result**: Legal moat protecting their position

</Tabs>

## The True Cost of Monopoly

### What 99% Control Means for Humanity

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Economic Devastation">

**&#36;15 Trillion Wealth Transfer**

When Big Tech owns 99% of AI:
- **1 billion jobs automated** = &#36;30 trillion in lost wages
- **All value flows upward** to tech shareholders
- **Local economies collapse** as money concentrates in Silicon Valley
- **Small businesses can't compete** with AI-powered giants
- **Innovation dies** - no competition means no progress

**The Critical Truth**: As hundreds of millions of jobs get displaced by AI ([See 1 Billion Jobs Will Be Displaced](/the-action-model/1-billion-jobs-will-be-displaced)), the money flow will be diverted from people (employed) to Big Tech (Agents). Every salary that disappears becomes subscription revenue for tech giants.

The greatest concentration of wealth in human history.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Social Catastrophe">

**Digital Feudalism Emerges**

The new social hierarchy:
- **0.0001%**: Tech executives and major shareholders
- **0.1%**: Tech employees with equity
- **10%**: Service workers for the tech elite
- **89.9%**: The displaced, dependent on Universal Basic Income

Society splits into tech lords and digital serfs.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Political Control">

**Democracy Becomes Decoration**

With economic power comes political domination:
- **Campaign funding** - unlimited resources to buy elections
- **Media control** - owning the platforms where discourse happens
- **Surveillance capability** - knowing everything about everyone
- **Behavioral manipulation** - AI that shapes thoughts and actions
- **Dependency creation** - controlling essential services

Whoever controls AI controls society itself.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Innovation Extinction">

**The End of Human Progress**

Monopolies kill innovation:
- **No competition** = no pressure to improve
- **Rent-seeking** replaces value creation
- **Barriers to entry** become insurmountable
- **Open source dies** - can't compete with closed resources
- **Human creativity atrophies** - why create when AI does it better?

We enter a permanent technological dark age.

## Why LAMs Make It Worse

### The Ultimate Monopoly Tool

Large Action Models represent an exponential increase in Big Tech's power:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Complete Automation">

LAMs don't just generate text, they perform actual work:
- **Control computers** like humans do
- **Navigate any interface** without APIs
- **Complete complex tasks** end-to-end
- **Replace entire roles**, not just tasks

This means Big Tech can automate literally any computer-based job.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Impossible Moat">

LAMs require resources only Big Tech has:
- **Massive training data** from GUI interactions
- **Enormous compute** for model training
- **Complex infrastructure** for deployment
- **Years of development** already invested

The barrier to entry is insurmountable for newcomers.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Network Effects">

LAMs create winner-take-all dynamics:
- **More users = more data**
- **More data = better models**
- **Better models = more users**
- **Infinite loop** of competitive advantage

Once ahead, Big Tech becomes uncatchable.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## The Only Alternative

### Why Action Model Is the Last Hope

<Note>

**The Uncomfortable Truth**: If Action Model fails, Big Tech's monopoly becomes permanent. There won't be a second chance at community-owned AI.

</Note>

<Info>

**With Action Model, you can own a stake in AI.** Instead of your data enriching Big Tech, you become a stakeholder in the AI revolution. **Action Model is the Resistance** ([See Action Model is the Uprising](/the-action-model/action-model-is-the-uprising)).

## The Final Warning

<Note>

**To Those Who Think This Is Hyperbole**: Look at every other industry Big Tech has entered. Search. Social. Shopping. Cloud. The pattern is always the same: enter, dominate, extract. AI is their ultimate play.

**To Those Who Think It's Too Late**: It's not, but barely. We have a narrow window where collective action can still make a difference. That window is measured in months.

**To Those Ready to Fight**: You're not alone. Millions are waking up to this reality. Together, we can build the alternative. Together, we can prevent the monopoly.
