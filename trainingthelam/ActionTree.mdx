title: "Action Tree"
description: "The proprietary data structure that maps every possible user interaction across the internet, enabling precise GUI automation"
---

The Action Tree is the technological foundation of Action Model's Large Action Model (LAM). It's a comprehensive, interconnected map of how to perform virtually any task on the internet, built from millions of real user journeys contributed by the community.

<Info>
  The Action Tree transforms unpredictable AI interactions into deterministic,
  pre-validated paths with near-perfect accuracy.
</Info>

## How the Action Tree Works

Unlike traditional LLMs that guess the next action or rigid RPA scripts that follow inflexible paths, the Action Tree provides a revolutionary approach to GUI automation.

## Action Branches: Building Blocks of Intelligence

Each complete user journey captured through the browser extension becomes an **Action Branch** - a precise, sequential record of how to accomplish a specific task.

### Anatomy of an Action Branch

<Steps>
<Step title="Intent Recognition">
  The system identifies what the user is trying to accomplish based on their initial actions and context
</Step>

<Step title="Action Sequence Recording">
  Every interaction is captured with millisecond precision: - Mouse movements
  and click coordinates - Keyboard inputs and shortcuts - Form field
  interactions - Scroll positions - Page transitions
</Step>

<Step title="Goal Achievement">
  The branch is completed when the user successfully achieves their objective, creating a validated path from intent to completion
</Step>
</Steps>

### Example Action Branch

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Hotel Booking">
  **Intent**: Book a hotel in Paris for next weekend
  
  **Recorded Actions**:
  1. Navigate to booking.com
  2. Click search field (coordinates: 412, 156)
  3. Type "Paris, France"
  4. Click date picker (coordinates: 589, 156)
  5. Select check-in date
  6. Select check-out date
  7. Click search button (coordinates: 750, 156)
  8. Apply filters (price range, rating)
  9. Click on hotel listing (coordinates: 380, 420)
  10. Select room type
  11. Fill guest information
  12. Complete booking confirmation
  
  **Goal**: Booking confirmation received
</Tab>

<Tab title="DevOps Deployment">
  **Intent**: Deploy application to Kubernetes cluster
  
  **Recorded Actions**:
  1. Open terminal application
  2. Navigate to project directory
  3. Run kubectl commands
  4. Access Kubernetes dashboard
  5. Click deployments section (coordinates: 180, 320)
  6. Select namespace dropdown (coordinates: 450, 180)
  7. Choose production namespace
  8. Click create deployment (coordinates: 680, 240)
  9. Configure deployment parameters
  10. Apply configuration
  11. Monitor rollout status
  
  **Goal**: Application successfully deployed
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Data Collection: Precision at Every Level

The browser extension captures an incredibly rich dataset for each user interaction, ensuring the LAM can accurately reproduce actions across different screens and resolutions.

### Captured Data Points

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Visual Data" icon="image">
  - **Full screen screenshots** at each interaction point
  - **Element-specific screenshots** of buttons, forms, and interactive components
  - **Visual context** including surrounding elements and page layout
  - **Color and style information** for visual recognition
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Structural Data" icon="code">
  - **Complete DOM tree** at the moment of interaction - **HTML element
  properties** (id, class, attributes) - **CSS selectors** for precise element
  targeting - **XPath expressions** for complex element identification
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Interaction Data" icon="hand-pointer">
  - **Absolute mouse coordinates** at click time - **Relative coordinates** as
  ratio to screen dimensions - **Element-relative positions** for responsive
  design compatibility - **Timing information** between actions - **Keyboard
  inputs** including shortcuts and modifiers
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Context Data" icon="globe">
  - **URL and navigation history**
  - **Page load timing**
  - **Network requests** triggered by actions
  - **Browser viewport dimensions**
  - **User agent and browser information**
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Coordinate Mapping System

The Action Tree employs a sophisticated coordinate mapping system that ensures actions work across different screen sizes and resolutions.

### Relative Positioning Algorithm

```javascript
// Coordinate normalization for cross-device compatibility
const normalizedCoordinates = {
  x_ratio: clickX / screenWidth, // e.g., 0.34 (34% from left)
  y_ratio: clickY / screenHeight, // e.g., 0.52 (52% from top)
  element_offset_x: clickX - elementBounds.left,
  element_offset_y: clickY - elementBounds.top,
  viewport_relative: {
    x: clickX / viewportWidth,
    y: clickY / viewportHeight,
  },
};
```

<Note>
  This multi-layered coordinate system ensures that actions recorded on a 4K
  monitor work perfectly on a laptop screen, maintaining precision across all
  devices.
</Note>

## Tree Formation: From Branches to Forest

Millions of Action Branches are algorithmically combined to create the comprehensive Action Tree through a sophisticated aggregation process.

### The Aggregation Process

<Steps>
<Step title="Branch Collection">
  Continuous collection of Action Branches from millions of community members, each contributing their unique workflows and patterns
</Step>

<Step title="Pattern Recognition">
  AI algorithms identify common patterns and variations across similar tasks,
  recognizing different paths to the same goal
</Step>

<Step title="Branch Interconnection">
  Related branches are linked at common junction points, creating a web of
  possible paths through any application
</Step>

<Step title="Validation & Optimization">
  The most efficient and reliable paths are prioritized, with success rates
  tracked for continuous improvement
</Step>

<Step title="Tree Synthesis">
  All validated branches merge into the unified Action Tree, creating a comprehensive map of digital interactions
</Step>
</Steps>

### Network Effects

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Growing Coverage" icon="chart-line">
    Each new user adds unique paths and edge cases, expanding the tree's
    capability to handle diverse scenarios
  </Card>
  <Card title="Improved Accuracy" icon="bullseye">
    Multiple recordings of the same task validate and refine the optimal path,
    increasing success rates
  </Card>
  <Card title="Faster Adaptation" icon="bolt">
    When websites update, active users naturally retrain affected branches
    through normal usage
  </Card>
  <Card title="Language Agnostic" icon="language">
    The visual and structural approach works across all languages and locales
    without translation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Self-Healing Properties

One of the Action Tree's most powerful features is its ability to automatically adapt to changes in website interfaces.

### How Self-Healing Works

<Tabs>
<Tab title="UI Changes">
  When a website updates its design:
  
  1. **Detection**: The LAM identifies that stored paths no longer match the current interface
  2. **Community Retraining**: As users naturally interact with the updated site, new branches are created
  3. **Automatic Updates**: The Action Tree incorporates these new branches, replacing outdated paths
  4. **Seamless Transition**: The LAM continues to function without manual intervention
</Tab>

<Tab title="A/B Testing">
  When sites run A/B tests with different interfaces: 1. **Multiple Path
  Recognition**: The tree maintains branches for each variation 2. **Context
  Awareness**: The LAM identifies which version is currently active 3.
  **Adaptive Selection**: Chooses the appropriate branch based on the detected
  variant 4. **Continuous Learning**: Accumulates data on all variations for
  robust operation
</Tab>

<Tab title="Dynamic Content">
  For sites with dynamic or personalized content:
  
  1. **Pattern Matching**: Recognizes structural patterns despite content changes
  2. **Flexible Selectors**: Uses multiple identification methods (visual, structural, contextual)
  3. **Fallback Strategies**: Maintains alternative paths when primary routes fail
  4. **Real-time Adaptation**: Adjusts to dynamic elements without pre-configuration
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
  Unlike traditional RPA that breaks with minor UI changes, the Action Tree's
  community-driven updates ensure continuous operation even as websites evolve.
</Warning>
