title: "Training the Large Action Model"
description: "Discover how Action Model trains the world's first community-owned Large Action Model. Learn the fundamental differences between LLMs and LAMs, and how millions of user journeys create the Action Tree that powers true AI automation."

<Warning>

**The AI Revolution's Dirty Secret**: LLMs can write poetry, but they can't book your flight. They can explain quantum physics, but they can't fill out a form. Action Model changes everything by training AI to actually *do* things, not just talk about them.

</Warning>

## The Problem: LLMs Can't Act

### Language Models Were Never Trained to Use Platforms

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="LLMs Training: Just Text" icon="language" color="#ef4444">

LLMs were trained on language—books, articles, websites. They never learned how to *use* platforms, only how to describe them.

</Card>

<Card title="99.9% Behind GUIs" icon="window-restore" color="#f59e0b">

The internet isn't text or APIs—it's graphical interfaces. Every button, form, and menu that humans navigate daily.

</Card>

<Card title="Can't Click or Navigate" icon="mouse-pointer" color="#ef4444">

LLMs weren't trained to click, type, or navigate. The internet remains unusable to traditional AI.

## LLMs vs LAMs: The Fundamental Difference

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Large Language Models" icon="comments">

### What LLMs Do

**Generate and understand text**
- Predict the next word in a sequence
- Generate human-like responses
- Process and analyze text

**Training Data**
- Books, articles, journals
- Websites, blogs, social media
- Scientific papers
- Easy to scrape from the internet

**Limitations**
- Cannot interact with GUIs
- Cannot perform actual actions
- Often hallucinate interface interactions
- Require APIs or integrations

</Tab>
<Tab title="Large Action Models" icon="hand-pointer">

### What LAMs Do

**Perform real actions on interfaces**
- Click buttons and links
- Fill out forms
- Navigate between pages
- Complete complex workflows

**Training Data**
- Real user GUI interactions
- Mouse movements and clicks
- Keyboard inputs
- Screenshots and DOM states
- **Must be intentionally collected**

**Capabilities**
- Direct GUI manipulation
- Platform-agnostic automation
- Human-like task completion
- No API requirements

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Why APIs Aren't the Solution

<Info>

**The API Myth**: Less than 0.1% of web functionality is exposed via APIs. Major platforms like Instagram and Booking.com actively restrict or eliminate API access. APIs are built for developers, not users—and they never expose full functionality.

</Info>

### GUIs Are for Humans, LAMs Are for Humans

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="API Limitations" icon="ban">

- Restricted functionality
- Developer-focused
- Often blocked or rate-limited
- Requires technical knowledge
- Platform-specific integration

</Card>

<Card title="GUI Advantages" icon="desktop">

- Full platform functionality
- Human-friendly interaction
- Universal approach
- No integration needed
- Works everywhere

## The Action Tree: Mapping the Interactive Internet

<Frame caption="The Action Tree - How millions of user journeys create a map of every possible action">
  <img src="/images/action-tree-concept.png" alt="Action Tree Visualization" />
</Frame>

### How User Journeys Become Intelligence

<Steps>
<Step title="User Performs Task">

A user completes a task naturally—booking a hotel, posting on social media, or managing emails—while the browser extension records.

</Step>

<Step title="Journey Recorded">

Every click, type, and navigation is captured along with context: DOM elements, screenshots, and environmental state.

</Step>

<Step title="Path Mapped">

The journey becomes a branch in the Action Tree, connecting with similar paths from other users.

</Step>

<Step title="Tree Grows">

Millions of journeys interweave, creating a comprehensive map of how to complete any task on any platform.

</Step>

<Step title="LAM Navigates">

When given a goal, the LAM traverses the Action Tree to find the optimal path, executing actions with human-like precision.

</Step>
</Steps>

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## The Training Process

### From Individual Actions to Collective Intelligence

<Info>

**The Network Effect**: Every user journey makes the model smarter. When one person books a flight on a new airline website, millions can now automate that same task. This is the power of community training.

</Info>

### Data Collection Methodology

| Component | What's Captured | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **DOM Elements** | HTML structure, element IDs, classes | Identify clickable/interactive elements |
| **Screenshots** | Visual state at each step | Understand visual context and layout |
| **Mouse Coordinates** | Exact click positions | Precise action replay |
| **Keyboard Input** | Text entered, keys pressed | Form filling and navigation |
| **URL Navigation** | Page transitions and routes | Understand site structure |
| **Network Requests** | API calls and responses | Capture dynamic content |
| **Timing Data** | Delays and load times | Realistic action pacing |
| **Error States** | Failed attempts and recovery | Robust error handling |

## Community Training at Scale

### The Resistance Builds Together

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="2M+ Trainers" icon="users">

Active community members training the LAM across millions of websites daily.

</Card>

<Card title="10B+ Actions" icon="mouse">

Individual actions recorded, labeled, and integrated into the Action Tree.

</Card>

<Card title="100K+ Platforms" icon="globe">

</CardGroup>

## Real-World Example: Multi-Platform Workflow

<Note>

**Complex Task**: "Find trending news on X/Twitter, create a graphic in Canva, and post to Instagram"

</Note>

### How LAMs Execute Complex Chains

<Steps>
<Step title="Understand Intent">

Parse the user's goal into a sequence of sub-tasks across multiple platforms.

</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to X/Twitter">

Use the Action Tree to find the path: Open browser → Navigate to X → Login if needed

</Step>

<Step title="Find Trending Content">

Click explore → Identify trending topics → Extract relevant content

</Step>

<Step title="Open Canva">

Navigate to Canva → Select template → Insert extracted content

</Step>

<Step title="Create Graphic">

Use design tools → Apply styling → Download image

</Step>

<Step title="Post to Instagram">

Navigate to Instagram → Click create post → Upload image → Add caption → Publish

</Step>
</Steps>

## The Training Paradox

<Warning>

**Big Tech's Dilemma**: Training a LAM requires massive-scale user interaction data that even Google and Microsoft struggle to collect. Why? Because they can't watch every user's screen. But we can—with permission, transparency, and rewards.

</Warning>

### Why Action Model Will Win

| Factor | Big Tech | Action Model |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Data Collection** | Limited to their platforms | Every website, every platform |
| **User Incentive** | None (they take your data) | Earn tokens for contribution |
| **Training Speed** | Slow, corporate processes | Rapid, community-driven |
| **Coverage** | Their ecosystem only | The entire internet |
| **Ownership** | Shareholders | Community members |
