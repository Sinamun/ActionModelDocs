<Warning>

**The Early Bird Owns the Future**: Founding members earn 5x multipliers. Epoch 1 participants get 2x. Every month you wait, your earning potential decreases. The revolution rewards those who join first.

## Points: Your Path to Token Ownership

### Building Your Stake in AI

Before the Token Generation Event (TGE), all contributions earn points. These points will convert directly to $LAM tokens, representing your ownership stake in the world's first community-owned AI.

### Rewarding Early Contributors

  <img src="/tokenomics/images/EPOCH.png" alt="Badge Tier Progression" />
</Frame>

<Info>

**Time-Sensitive Opportunity**: Each epoch represents a month in Action Model's journey. The earlier you join, the higher your permanent multiplier. Founding members earn 5x. By month 12, it's down to 1x‚Äîforever.

</Info>


### Epoch Multipliers

| Epoch | Period | Multiplier | Points per 1000 Actions | Status |
|-------|--------|------------|------------------------|---------|
| **Founding** | Founders/KOLs | **5x** | 5,000 points | Exclusive |
| **Epoch 1** | Month 1 | **2x** | 2,000 points | Launch Month |
| **Epoch 2** | Month 2 | **1.9x** | 1,900 points | Early Adopter |
| **Epoch 3** | Month 3 | **1.8x** | 1,800 points | Early Bird |
| **Epoch 4** | Month 4 | **1.7x** | 1,700 points | Rising |
| **Epoch 5** | Month 5 | **1.6x** | 1,600 points | Growing |

<Warning>

**The Cost of Waiting**: Someone joining in Epoch 1 earns DOUBLE what someone joining in Epoch 12+ earns‚Äîpermanently. Every day you wait costs you future ownership.

</Warning>


## Calculating Your Earnings

### The Complete Formula

<Info>

**Your Total Points** = Base Actions √ó (1 + Badge Bonus + Epoch Bonus + Training Bonus + Bounty Bonus + Other Multipliers)

</Info>

### Real-World Examples

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Example 1: Founding Member Power User + Creator">

**Scenario**: Founding member, Tree tier, Active training on Stripe, Published workflow in Creator Epoch 1

**Training Earnings Calculation**:
- Base actions: 1,000
- Founding epoch: +400% (5x = +400%)
- Tree badge: +30%
- Active training: +100%
- Stripe bounty: +3100% (32x = +3100%)

**Training Total**: 1,000 √ó (1 + 4.0 + 0.3 + 1.0 + 31.0) = **37,300 $LAM**

**Creator Earnings (Monthly)**:
- Workflow usage: 10,000 executions consuming 500,000 tokens
- [Creator Epoch 1 rate](/tokenomics/marketplace-distributions#creator-epochs-time-based-reward-tiers): 33%
- Monthly creator earnings: 500,000 √ó 0.33 = **165,000 $LAM**

**Combined Monthly Total**: 37,300 + 165,000 = **202,300 $LAM**

*This user earns from both training the LAM and creating valuable workflows!*

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Example 2: Epoch 3 Active Trainer + Creator">

**Scenario**: Joined in Epoch 3, Leaf tier, Active training on LinkedIn, Published workflow in Creator Epoch 3

**Training Earnings Calculation**:

- Epoch 3: +80% (1.8x = +80%)
- Leaf badge: +15%
- Active training: +100%
- LinkedIn bounty: +200% (3x = +200%)

**Training Total**: 2,000 √ó (1 + 0.8 + 0.15 + 1.0 + 2.0) = **9,900 $LAM**

**Creator Earnings (Monthly)**:
- Workflow usage: 5,000 executions consuming 250,000 tokens
- [Creator Epoch 3 rate](/tokenomics/marketplace-distributions#creator-epochs-time-based-reward-tiers): 20%
- Monthly creator earnings: 250,000 √ó 0.20 = **50,000 $LAM**

**Combined Monthly Total**: 9,900 + 50,000 = **59,900 $LAM**

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Example 3: Casual Background Trainer + Late Creator">

**Scenario**: Epoch 6, Root tier, Background training on Gmail, Published workflow in Creator Epoch 8

**Training Earnings Calculation**:
- Base actions: 5,000
- Epoch 6: +50% (1.5x = +50%)
- Root badge: +5%
- Background training: +0% (baseline)
- Gmail bounty: +20% (1.2x = +20%)

**Training Total**: 5,000 √ó (1 + 0.5 + 0.05 + 0 + 0.2) = **8,750 $LAM**

**Creator Earnings (Monthly)**:
- Workflow usage: 5,000 executions consuming 250,000 tokens
- [Creator Epoch 8 rate](/tokenomics/marketplace-distributions#creator-epochs-time-based-reward-tiers): 7.5%
- Monthly creator earnings: 250,000 √ó 0.075 = **18,750 $LAM**

**Combined Monthly Total**: 8,750 + 18,750 = **27,500 $LAM**

*Note: Same workflow usage as Example 2, but earns 62.5% less due to later Creator Epoch!*

## Points to Token Conversion

### From Training Points to Real Ownership

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Token Generation Event" icon="rocket">

**Your Points Become $LAM**

At TGE, all accumulated points convert to $LAM tokens. Your share is proportional to your total points versus all community points earned.

</Card>

<Card title="Community Pool" icon="users">

**350 Million $LAM Reserved**

35% of the total 1 billion token supply is allocated exclusively to community contributors who trained the LAM.

</CardGroup>

<Steps>
<Step title="Earn Points Now">
