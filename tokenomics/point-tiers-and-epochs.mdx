title: "Point Tiers and Epochs"
description: "From points to ownership. Learn how the tier system, epochs, and multipliers reward early contributors and dedicated trainers with their stake in the AI revolution."

<Warning>

**The Early Bird Owns the Future**: Founding members earn 5x multipliers. Epoch 1 participants get 2x. Every month you wait, your earning potential decreases. The revolution rewards those who join first.

</Warning>

## Points: Your Path to Token Ownership

### Building Your Stake in AI

Before the Token Generation Event (TGE), all contributions earn points. These points will convert directly to $LAM tokens, representing your ownership stake in the world's first community-owned AI.

- Base points: 1,000
- Tree bonus: +30%
- Epoch bonus: +40% (if in Epoch 7)
- Platform bounty: +100% (gold platform)

## The Epoch System

### Rewarding Early Believers

### Epoch Multipliers

| Epoch | Period | Multiplier | Points per 1000 Actions | Status |
|-------|--------|------------|------------------------|---------|
| **Founding** | Founders/KOLs | **5x** | 5,000 points | Exclusive |
| **Epoch 1** | Month 1 | **2x** | 2,000 points | Launch Month |
| **Epoch 2** | Month 2 | **1.9x** | 1,900 points | Early Adopter |
| **Epoch 3** | Month 3 | **1.8x** | 1,800 points | Early Bird |

</Warning>

## Calculating Your Earnings

### The Complete Formula

<Info>

**Your Total Points** = Base Actions √ó (1 + Badge Bonus + Epoch Bonus + Training Bonus + Bounty Bonus + Other Multipliers)

</Info>

### Real-World Examples

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Example 1: Founding Member Power User">

**Scenario**: Founding member, Tree tier, Active training on Stripe

**Calculation**:
- Base actions: 1,000
- Founding epoch: +400% (5x = +400%)
- Tree badge: +30%
- Active training: +100%
- Stripe bounty: +3100% (32x = +3100%)

**Total**: 1,000 √ó (1 + 4.0 + 0.3 + 1.0 + 31.0) = **37,300 points**

*For just 1,000 actions, this user earns what would take a standard user 37,300 actions to earn!*

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Example 2: Epoch 3 Active Trainer">

**Scenario**: Joined in Epoch 3, Leaf tier, Active training on LinkedIn

**Calculation**:
- Base actions: 2,000
- Epoch 3: +80% (1.8x = +80%)
- Leaf badge: +15%
- Active training: +100%
- LinkedIn bounty: +200% (3x = +200%)

**Total**: 2,000 √ó (1 + 0.8 + 0.15 + 1.0 + 2.0) = **9,900 points**

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Example 3: Casual Background Trainer">

**Scenario**: Epoch 6, Root tier, Background training on Gmail

**Calculation**:
- Base actions: 5,000
- Epoch 6: +50% (1.5x = +50%)
- Root badge: +5%
- Background training: +0% (baseline)
- Gmail bounty: +20% (1.2x = +20%)

**Total**: 5,000 √ó (1 + 0.5 + 0.05 + 0 + 0.2) = **8,750 points**
