</Steps>

## Commission Structure

### Understanding Your Network Earnings

<Info>

**Hybrid Commission Model**: You earn based on your tier level (5-25%) from your direct referrals' training activity. Additionally, you earn 25% of what your referrals earn from their own referral networks, creating cascading rewards through layers 2 and 3.

</Info>

### How Your Earnings Work

| Layer | Relationship | How You Earn | Example Calculation |
|-------|--------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **L1** | Direct Referrals | Your tier % of their training points | User trains 100k pts, you're Tier 3 (15%) → You earn 15k |
| **L2** | Their Referrals | 25% of what L1 earns from L2 | L1 earns 15k from their referral → You earn 3.75k |
| **L3** | Third Generation | 25% of what L2 earns from L3 | L2 earns 3.75k from their referral → You earn 0.94k |

<Warning>

**The Cascading Effect**: With the 25% cascading commission model, your earnings compound through the network. As your referrals build their own networks and earn commissions, you automatically earn 25% of their commission earnings, creating multiple income streams from a single referral chain.
