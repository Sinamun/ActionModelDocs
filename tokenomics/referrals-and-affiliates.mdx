## Commission Structure

### Understanding Your Network Earnings

<Info>

**Cascading Commission Model**: You earn 25% of what each layer below you earns. When your direct referrals earn commissions from their referrals, you get 25% of those commissions. This creates a cascading reward system where your earnings compound as your network grows deeper.

</Info>

### How the Cascading 25% Works

| Layer | Relationship | How You Earn | Example Calculation |
|-------|--------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **L1** | Direct Referrals | 25% of their training points | User trains 100k pts → You earn 25k |
| **L2** | Their Referrals | 25% of what L1 earns from L2 | L1 earns 25k from their referral → You earn 6.25k |
| **L3** | Third Generation | 25% of what L2 earns from L3 | L2 earns 6.25k from their referral → You earn 1.56k |

<Warning>

**The Cascading Effect**: With the 25% cascading commission model, your earnings compound through the network. As your referrals build their own networks and earn commissions, you automatically earn 25% of their commission earnings, creating multiple income streams from a single referral chain.

</Warning>
