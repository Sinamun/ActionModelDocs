## Affiliate Reward Tiers & Referral Bonuses

To encourage community growth, you can earn extra points by referring others. There are two ways you benefit:

### 1. Affiliate Earnings – Ongoing Percentage of Referees' Points

As your number of successful referrals grows, so does the percentage of their earned points you receive — without affecting their points total.

| Tier | Number of Referrals | Affiliate Bonus (% of Referees' Points) |
|------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Tier 1** | 0–5 | 5% |
| **Tier 2** | 6–20 | 10% |
| **Tier 3** | 21–100 | 15% |
| **Tier 4** | 101–999 | 20% |
| **Tier 5** | 1000+ | 25% |

**Example calculation:**
Someone you referred earns 10,000 points in a session. If you're in Tier 3 (15%), you'll receive:
ROUND(10,000 * 15 / 100) = 1,500 bonus points

### 2. One-Time Referral Bonuses

You'll also receive fixed bonus points at two key milestones for each person you refer:

| Tier | Initial Bonus (on sign-up) | Qualified Bonus (after 10min recording) | Total Bonus |
|------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Tier 1** | 1000 points | 4000 points | 5000 |
| **Tier 2** | 2000 points | 8000 points | 10000 |
| **Tier 3** | 4000 points | 16000 points | 20000 |
| **Tier 4** | 8000 points | 32,000 points | 40000 |
| **Tier 5** | 16,000 points | 64,000 points | 80000 |

The "Qualified Bonus" is granted once the referred user completes at least 100 hours of recording (Roughly 4 days of background training)
