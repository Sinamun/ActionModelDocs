## The 3-Layer Revolution

### Your Network, Your Empire

</Frame>

<Steps>
<Step title="Get Your Unique Code">

Every user receives a personalized referral code: @yourname

</Step>

<Step title="Share Your Code">

Invite friends, colleagues, and community members to join using your code

</Step>

<Step title="They Start Training">

When they install the extension and begin training, you earn from every action

</Step>

<Step title="They Invite Others">

When your referrals invite people, you earn from those users too (Layer 2)

</Step>

<Step title="Network Expands">

Third-generation users also contribute to your earnings (Layer 3)

</Step>

<Step title="Passive Income Forever">

As long as your network remains active, you earn without doing anything

</Step>
</Steps>

## Commission Structure

### Understanding Your Network Earnings

<Info>

**Permanent Passive Income**: Once someone joins through your link, you earn from their activity forever. No expiration. No limits. This is true network ownership.

</Info>

### Layer Breakdown

| Layer | Relationship | Commission | Example Network | Monthly Earnings |
|-------|--------------|------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **L1** | Direct Referrals | 25% | 10 active users @ 100k pts/mo | 250,000 points |
| **L2** | Their Referrals | 10% | 50 users @ 100k pts/mo | 500,000 points |
| **L3** | Third Generation | 5% | 250 users @ 100k pts/mo | 1,250,000 points |
| | | | **Total Network: 310 users** | **2,000,000 pts/mo** |

<Warning>

**The Compound Effect**: If each person you invite brings just 5 others, and they each bring 5, your network reaches 156 people. At average activity levels, that's 2M+ points monthly without you training at all.

</Warning>
