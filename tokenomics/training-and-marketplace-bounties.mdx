## Calculating Bounty Earnings

### The Compound Effect

<Note>

**Multipliers Stack**: Bounty multipliers combine with your tier bonuses, epoch multipliers, and training mode. The math can be staggering.

</Note>

### Complete Earnings Formula

```
Total Points = Base Actions Ã— (1 + Tier Bonus + Epoch Bonus + Training Mode Bonus + Bounty Multiplier)
```

### Real Examples

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Example 1: ICP Bounty Hunter">

**Scenario**: Training on Internet Computer platform

- Tier: Branch (20% bonus)
- Epoch: 3 (80% bonus)
- Mode: Active (100% bonus)
- Actions: 1,000

<br/>

**Calculation**:
```
1,000 Ã— (1 + 0.2 + 0.8 + 1.0 + 72.0) = 75,000 points
```

<br/>

**Earnings**: 75,000 points from just 1,000 actions!
