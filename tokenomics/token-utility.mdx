<Info>

**LAM is Action Fuel**: Unlike speculative tokens, LAM has real utility‚Äîevery click, type, and navigation performed by AI agents consumes $LAM. This isn't a currency; it's the gasoline that powers the automation economy.

</Info>

## The $LAM Token: Powering the Action Economy

### More Than a Token‚ÄîIt's Ownership

LAM represents a fundamental shift in how AI value is created and distributed. When Big Tech's AI performs actions, they keep 100% of the value. When Action Model's AI performs actions, the value flows back to the community through $LAM.

## $LAM Token Overview

<Note>

**LAM is Action Fuel:** Every GUI action executed by a LAM agent consumes $LAM.

</Note>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Dynamic Pricing Model" icon="calculator">

**Price-in-USD per action is fixed** by LAM version (e.g., LAM-1 = $0.01/action), while the number of tokens per action floats with the token price.

</Card>

<Card title="Token Distribution" icon="chart-pie">

Each consumed action distributes tokens: **34% Burn**, **33% Marketplace Distribution**, **33% Action Model Foundation** (foundation ops, rewards, R&amp;D).

</Card>

<Card title="Buy Pressure Engine" icon="arrow-trend-up">

**B2B + Partners create continuous buy pressure.** Subscriptions and API usage require $LAM purchases to fund actions. Paying subscriptions directly in LAM grants a 10% discount.

</Card>

<Card title="Deflationary Dynamics" icon="fire">

**Because a share of every action is burned**, higher usage permanently reduces supply; the rest recirculates to creators/foundation to grow the ecosystem.

## How $LAM Powers Every Action

### The Action Loop

<Frame caption="The Action Loop - How Each AI Decision Consumes $LAM">
  <img src="/tokenomics/images/Action-Loop.png" alt="Action Loop Token Consumption" />
</Frame>

<Steps>
<Step title="Environment Input">

The LAM receives the current state: screenshot, DOM, user goal, and action history

</Step>

<Step title="Tree Search">

The AI searches the Action Tree to find the optimal next action

</Step>

<Step title="Action Decision">

The LAM determines the precise GUI action to execute

</Step>

<Step title="$LAM Consumption">

This single action consumes $LAM tokens based on the current pricing model

</Step>

<Step title="Action Execution">

The action is performed (click, type, navigate, etc.)

</Step>

<Step title="Loop Continues">

Process repeats until the goal is achieved or time expires

</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>

**Every Iteration = Billable Action**: Each loop through this process is one action that consumes $LAM. A complex workflow might require 100+ actions, creating continuous token demand.

</Warning>

## Token Economics Model

### Fixed USD Pricing, Floating Token Cost

<Info>

**Price Stability for Businesses**: The USD cost per action is fixed by LAM version (e.g., LAM-1 = $0.01/action), while the number of tokens consumed adjusts with market price. This gives businesses predictable costs while allowing token value to appreciate.

</Info>

### Pricing Formula

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Basic Formula" icon="calculator">

For LAM version `v` with USD price per action `pv`:

**Tokens Required Per Action:**
```
œÑ(v,t) = pv / Pt
```

Where:
- `œÑ(v,t)` = Tokens required per action at time t
- `pv` = USD price per action for version v
- `Pt` = Market price of $LAM in USD at time t

</Tab>
<Tab title="Examples" icon="chart-bar">

### LAM-1 Examples (p1 = $0.01/action)

| Token Price | Tokens Per Action | 1000 Actions Cost |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| $0.001 | 10 tokens | 10,000 tokens |
| $0.01 | 1 token | 1,000 tokens |
| $0.10 | 0.1 tokens | 100 tokens |
| $1.00 | 0.01 tokens | 10 tokens |

**Key Insight**: As token price increases, fewer tokens are needed per action, benefiting early holders.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Token Distribution Per Action

### Where Every $LAM Goes

<Frame caption="Token Distribution - Creating Value Through Every Action">
  <img src="/tokenomics/images/token-distribution.png" alt="Token Distribution Diagram" />
</Frame>

When an action consumes tokens, they are distributed as follows:

### Distribution Mathematics

For each action consuming `œÑ` tokens:
- **Burned**: `0.34 √ó œÑ` tokens
- **Creator**: `0.33 √ó œÑ` tokens (if marketplace workflow)
- **Foundation**: `0.33 √ó œÑ` tokens

Businesses can pay subscriptions directly in $LAM tokens for a 10% discount:

<Info>

**Example**: $1,000 monthly subscription
- Pay in USD: $1,000
- Pay in $LAM: $900 worth of tokens

This incentivizes businesses to hold and use $LAM, creating additional buy pressure.

</Info>

## Formal Tokenomics Model

### Mathematical Framework

### Pricing Model (Versioned "Price Per Action")

- Let `p·µ•` be the **USD price per action** for model version `v` (e.g., LAM-1 has `p‚ÇÅ = $0.10` per action)
- Let `P‚Çú` be the **market price of $LAM in USD** at time `t`
- **Tokens required per action** for version `v` at time `t` is:

<Info>

**Formula:**
```
œÑ·µ•,‚Çú = p·µ• / P‚Çú
```

</Info>

**Fractional tokens** are supported to meter actions precisely.

#### Examples (LAM-1):
- If `P‚Çú = $0.01`, then `œÑ‚ÇÅ,‚Çú = 0.10 / 0.01 = 10 tokens/action`
- If `P‚Çú = $0.10`, then `œÑ‚ÇÅ,‚Çú = 1 token/action`
- If `P‚Çú = $1.00`, then `œÑ‚ÇÅ,‚Çú = 0.1 token/action`

**USD cost per action is stable for developers; tokens per action adjusts automatically to market price.**

---

### Token Fuel Distribution (Per Action)

Let the distribution shares be:
- **Burn share** `Œ≤ = 0.34`
- **Marketplace creator share** `Œº = 0.33`
- **Foundation share** `œÜ = 0.33`

For one action that consumes `œÑ` tokens:

```
Burned tokens/action = Œ≤ ¬∑ œÑ
Creator tokens/action = Œº ¬∑ œÑ    (if a Marketplace workflow was used)
Foundation tokens/action = œÜ ¬∑ œÑ
```

#### USD Equivalents Per Action:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card>

**USD burned/action = Œ≤ ¬∑ p·µ•**

</Card>
<Card>

**USD to creator/action = Œº ¬∑ p·µ•**

</Card>
<Card>

**USD to foundation/action = œÜ ¬∑ p·µ•**

</Card>
</CardGroup>

For LAM-1 (`p‚ÇÅ = $0.10`): **$0.034** is burned, **$0.033** goes to the creator (if used), and **$0.033** to the foundation **per action**, independent of token price.

<Note>

**No-Marketplace case**: If a run doesn't use a Marketplace workflow, the creator share can be (a) retained in an **Ecosystem Rewards** pool or (b) redirected to the **Foundation**. The DAO should ratify the default.

</Note>

---

### The Buyback Loop (Why Usage Creates Demand)

- **B2B subscriptions** (e.g., $1k‚Äì$2k per agent/month) and **API partners** include usage allowances measured in actions
- To deliver those actions, **operators must acquire $LAM** (buy on the market or hold inventory)
- When actions run, tokens flow through the **Fuel distribution** above (with 34% burned)

#### Paying Subscriptions in $LAM (10% Discount)

- Paying a $1,000 subscription in $LAM yields a **10% discount**: you spend tokens equivalent to **$900** at the time of payment
- Those tokens may be escrowed and released into the Fuel distribution as actions are consumed (implementation detail‚ÄîDAO parameter)

**Tokens needed to pay a subscription `S` in USD with a discount `d`:**

<Info>

**Formula:**
```
Tokens = S(1 - d) / P‚Çú
```

</Info>

---

### Advanced Tokenomics Calculations

#### Per-Action Accounting (LAM-v)

- **Tokens per action:** `œÑ·µ•,‚Çú = p·µ• / P‚Çú`
- **Burn:** `B‚Çêc‚Çú = Œ≤œÑ·µ•,‚Çú`
- **Creator:** `M‚Çêc‚Çú = ŒºœÑ·µ•,‚Çú ¬∑ ùüômarketplace`
- **Foundation:** `F‚Çêc‚Çú = œÜœÑ·µ•,‚Çú`

#### Network-Level, Period t (e.g., monthly)

Let `A‚Çú` be actions executed in `t`. Then:

```
Tokens needed    D‚Çú = œÑ·µ•,‚Çú ¬∑ A‚Çú
Burned tokens    B‚Çú = Œ≤ ¬∑ D‚Çú
Creator tokens   M‚Çú = Œº ¬∑ D‚Çú ¬∑ Pr(marketplace use)
Foundation tokens F‚Çú = œÜ ¬∑ D‚Çú
USD spent on actions U‚Çú = p·µ• ¬∑ A‚Çú    (price-invariant)
```

#### Supply Dynamics

Let `S‚Çú` be circulating supply at start of `t`. Let `E‚Çú` be new emissions (training rewards, grants) approved by DAO.

<Info>

**Supply Evolution:**
```
S‚Çú‚Çä‚ÇÅ = S‚Çú + E‚Çú - B‚Çú
```

</Info>

**Conditions:**
- **Deflationary condition:** `B‚Çú > E‚Çú`
- **Neutral:** `B‚Çú = E‚Çú`
- **Inflationary:** `B‚Çú < E‚Çú`

**Break-even emissions (deflation-neutral):**

<Info>

**Formula:**
```
E*‚Çú = Œ≤ ¬∑ œÑ·µ•,‚Çú ¬∑ A‚Çú
```

</Info>

#### "Half-Life" Under Constant Burn and No Emissions (Illustrative)

If actions are steady and `E‚Çú = 0`, supply declines linearly. Time to reduce supply by half:

<Info>

**Half-Life Formula:**
```
T‚ÇÅ/‚ÇÇ = S‚ÇÄ / (2 ¬∑ B‚Çú) = S‚ÇÄ / (2 ¬∑ Œ≤ ¬∑ œÑ·µ•,‚Çú ¬∑ A‚Çú)
```

</Info>

## Token Training Distribution

### Rewarding Data Contributors

<Info>

**Future Enhancement**: A portion of consumed $LAM may be distributed to trainers who provided the action branches/trees used in executed workflows.

</Info>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="How It Works" icon="share-nodes">

When users train the LAM by demonstrating actions (e.g., creating an AWS EC2 instance), they contribute to the Action Tree. When workflows use these trained paths, contributors earn rewards.

**Example Flow:**
1. 1,000 users train "Create EC2 Instance" action
2. Enterprise workflow uses this action path
3. Training distribution portion flows to those 1,000 trainers
4. Rewards proportional to contribution quality

</Card>

<Card title="Incentive Alignment" icon="handshake">

**Benefits:**
- Rewards quality training data
- Incentivizes rare/complex actions
- Creates passive income for trainers
- Improves model accuracy

**Distribution Formula:**
```
Trainer Reward = (Quality Score √ó Usage Count) / Total Contributors
```

</Card>

## Long-Term Economic Benefits

### Why $LAM Creates Sustainable Value

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Price-Stable UX" icon="shield-halved">

**Predictable Costs for Business**

Customers think in actions and USD, not token volatility. The floating token model ensures:
- Fixed USD cost per action
- No surprise bills from price swings
- Easy budgeting for enterprises
- Seamless B2B adoption

</Card>

<Card title="Automatic Market Clearing" icon="scale-balanced">

**Counter-Cyclical Demand**

As $LAM price changes, token consumption auto-adjusts:
- Price rises ‚Üí Fewer tokens needed per action
- Price falls ‚Üí More tokens needed per action
- USD revenue remains stable
- Natural price discovery mechanism

</Card>

<Card title="Permanent Scarcity Creation" icon="fire-flame-curved">

**Usage = Value**

Every action permanently removes supply:
- 34% burn rate compounds over time
- Millions of daily actions = massive burns
- Supply decreases while demand grows
- Mathematical path to appreciation

</Card>

<Card title="Creator Alignment" icon="hand-holding-dollar">

**Earn Real Value, Not Speculation**

Creators receive cash-equivalent rewards:
- 33% of action value in any market
- Income tied to usage, not price
- Incentivizes quality over hype
- Sustainable creator economy

</Card>
</CardGroup>

### The Compound Effect

<Info>

**Mathematical Certainty**: With growing usage and constant burn rate, the following becomes inevitable:

1. **Year 1**: 10M daily actions ‚Üí 3.4M tokens burned daily
2. **Year 2**: 100M daily actions ‚Üí 34M tokens burned daily
3. **Year 3**: 500M daily actions ‚Üí 170M tokens burned daily
4. **Year 5**: 2B daily actions ‚Üí 680M tokens burned daily

At scale, daily burns exceed total initial supply, creating extreme scarcity.
