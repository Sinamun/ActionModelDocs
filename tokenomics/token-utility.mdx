description: "The fuel that powers every action in the AI revolution. Learn how $LAM tokens create a self-sustaining economy where usage drives value, creators earn, and the community owns the future of automation."

<Info>

**$LAM is Action Fuel**: Unlike speculative tokens, $LAM has real utility—every click, type, and navigation performed by AI agents consumes $LAM. This isn't a currency; it's the gasoline that powers the automation economy.

</Info>

## $LAM Token Overview

<Note>

**$LAM is Action Fuel.** Every GUI action executed by a LAM agent consumes $LAM.

</Note>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Dynamic Pricing Model" icon="calculator">

**Price-in-USD per action is fixed** by LAM version (e.g., LAM-1 = $0.01/action), while the number of tokens per action floats with the token price.

</Card>

<Card title="Token Distribution" icon="chart-pie">

Each consumed action distributes tokens: **34% Burn**, **33% Marketplace Distribution**, **33% Action Model Foundation** (foundation ops, rewards, R&amp;D).

</Card>

<Card title="Buy Pressure Engine" icon="arrow-trend-up">

**B2B + Partners create continuous buy pressure.** Subscriptions and API usage require $LAM purchases to fund actions. Paying subscriptions directly in $LAM grants a 10% discount.

</Card>

<Card title="Deflationary Dynamics" icon="fire">

**Because a share of every action is burned**, higher usage permanently reduces supply; the rest recirculates to creators/foundation to grow the ecosystem.

## The $LAM Token: Powering the Action Economy

### More Than a Token—It's Ownership

$LAM represents a fundamental shift in how AI value is created and distributed. When Big Tech's AI performs actions, they keep 100% of the value. When Action Model's AI performs actions, the value flows back to the community through $LAM.

## How $LAM Powers Every Action

### The Action Loop

<Frame caption="The Action Loop - How Each AI Decision Consumes $LAM">
  <img src="/images/action-loop-tokenomics.png" alt="Action Loop Token Consumption" />
</Frame>

<Steps>
<Step title="Environment Input">

The LAM receives the current state: screenshot, DOM, user goal, and action history

</Step>

<Step title="Tree Search">

The AI searches the Action Tree to find the optimal next action

</Step>

<Step title="Action Decision">

The LAM determines the precise GUI action to execute

</Step>

<Step title="$LAM Consumption">

This single action consumes $LAM tokens based on the current pricing model

</Step>

<Step title="Action Execution">

The action is performed (click, type, navigate, etc.)

</Step>

<Step title="Loop Continues">

Process repeats until the goal is achieved or time expires

</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>

**Every Iteration = Billable Action**: Each loop through this process is one action that consumes $LAM. A complex workflow might require 100+ actions, creating continuous token demand.

</Warning>

## Token Economics Model

### Fixed USD Pricing, Floating Token Cost

<Info>

**Price Stability for Businesses**: The USD cost per action is fixed by LAM version (e.g., LAM-1 = $0.01/action), while the number of tokens consumed adjusts with market price. This gives businesses predictable costs while allowing token value to appreciate.

</Info>

### Pricing Formula

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Basic Formula" icon="calculator">

For LAM version `v` with USD price per action `pv`:

**Tokens Required Per Action:**
```
τ(v,t) = pv / Pt
```

Where:
- `τ(v,t)` = Tokens required per action at time t
- `pv` = USD price per action for version v
- `Pt` = Market price of $LAM in USD at time t

</Tab>
<Tab title="Examples" icon="chart-bar">

### LAM-1 Examples (p1 = $0.01/action)

| Token Price | Tokens Per Action | 1000 Actions Cost |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| $0.001 | 10 tokens | 10,000 tokens |
| $0.01 | 1 token | 1,000 tokens |
| $0.10 | 0.1 tokens | 100 tokens |
| $1.00 | 0.01 tokens | 10 tokens |

**Key Insight**: As token price increases, fewer tokens are needed per action, benefiting early holders.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Token Distribution Per Action

### Where Every $LAM Goes

<Frame caption="Token Distribution - Creating Value Through Every Action">
  <img src="/images/token-distribution.png" alt="Token Distribution Diagram" />
</Frame>

When an action consumes tokens, they are distributed as follows:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="34% Burned" icon="fire" color="#ef4444">

**Deflationary Mechanism**

Permanently removed from circulation, increasing scarcity with every action

</Card>

<Card title="33% to Creators" icon="user-plus" color="#10b981">

**Marketplace Rewards**

Goes to workflow creators when their automations are used

</Card>

<Card title="33% to Foundation" icon="building" color="#3b82f6">

**Ecosystem Growth**

Funds development, operations, rewards, and community initiatives

</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Distribution Mathematics

For each action consuming `τ` tokens:
- **Burned**: `0.34 × τ` tokens
- **Creator**: `0.33 × τ` tokens (if marketplace workflow)
- **Foundation**: `0.33 × τ` tokens

## The B2B Buyback Loop

### How Business Demand Drives Token Value

<Steps>
<Step title="Business Subscribes">

Enterprise pays $1,000-2,000/month per AI agent

</Step>

<Step title="Platform Buys $LAM">

Subscription revenue used to purchase $LAM from market

</Step>

<Step title="Agents Consume Tokens">

AI agents perform actions, consuming $LAM as fuel

</Step>

<Step title="Tokens Distributed">

34% burned, 33% to creators, 33% to foundation

</Step>

<Step title="Supply Decreases">

Burning reduces total supply permanently

</Step>

<Step title="Value Appreciates">

Decreased supply + continued demand = price appreciation

</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>

**The Virtuous Cycle**: More business usage → More token demand → More burning → Higher token value → More creator incentive → Better workflows → More business usage

</Warning>

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Subscription Discount Model

### Pay with $LAM, Save 10%

Businesses can pay subscriptions directly in $LAM tokens for a 10% discount:

<Info>

**Example**: $1,000 monthly subscription
- Pay in USD: $1,000
- Pay in $LAM: $900 worth of tokens

This incentivizes businesses to hold and use $LAM, creating additional buy pressure.

</Info>

### Discount Formula

```
Tokens Required = S × (1 - d) / Pt
```

Where:
- S = Subscription amount in USD
- d = Discount rate (0.10 for 10%)
- Pt = Current token price
