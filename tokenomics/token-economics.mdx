title: "Token Economics"
description: "The complete economic architecture of the $LAM ecosystem. Understand how deflationary mechanics, revenue cycles, and community incentives create the world's first self-sustaining AI economy where usage drives value and ownership is truly decentralized."
---

<Note>

**The Perfect Economic Storm**: $LAM combines the deflationary power of burning, the growth velocity of network effects, and the value creation of real B2B revenue. This isn't speculation—it's an economic revolution backed by actual utility.

</Note>

## The $LAM Economic Model

### A New Paradigm for AI Ownership

The $LAM token represents more than cryptocurrency—it's the foundation of a new economic system where AI value flows to the community that creates it, not corporate shareholders. Every aspect is designed to create sustainable, long-term value appreciation.

## The Deflationary Engine

### How Scarcity Drives Value

<Warning>

**Mathematical Certainty**: With 34% of tokens burned on every action and billions of daily actions projected, the supply will decrease dramatically. This isn't hope—it's math.

</Warning>

### Burn Mechanics

<Steps>
<Step title="Action Execution">

User or business executes an AI action that consumes tokens based on current pricing

</Step>

<Step title="Token Consumption">

Tokens are deducted from user's balance at market-determined rate

</Step>

<Step title="Immediate Burn">

34% of consumed tokens sent to burn address (0x000...dead)

</Step>

<Step title="Supply Reduction">

Total supply permanently decreased, visible on-chain

</Step>

<Step title="Scarcity Increase">

Remaining tokens become more scarce, supporting price appreciation

</Step>
</Steps>

## Velocity and Circulation

### Token Flow Dynamics

<Info>

**High Velocity, Low Float**: Tokens constantly circulate through the economy—earned, spent, burned, and re-earned. This creates healthy velocity while burning reduces float.

</Info>

### Circulation Patterns

## Price Discovery Mechanism

### How Value Is Determined

<Note>

**Market-Driven Pricing**: Unlike stablecoins or pegged assets, $LAM price floats freely based on supply, demand, and utility value. This allows for appreciation as the platform grows.

</Note>

|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Token Burns** | Reduces supply | ⬆️ Positive | High |
| **B2B Revenue** | Creates buy pressure | ⬆️ Positive | High |
