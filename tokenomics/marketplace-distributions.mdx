title: "Marketplace Distributions"
description: "Turn your automation expertise into passive income. Learn how the creator revenue share transforms workflow builders into AI entrepreneurs earning from every action their creations perform."
---

<Note>

**The Creator Revolution**: For the first time in AI history, those who build the automations earn from their usage. Every workflow you publish, every agent you create, generates continuous income as others leverage your innovation.

</Note>

## The Creator Economy

### Your Automations, Your Revenue Stream

When any workflow or agent you've created is used through the marketplace, you automatically receive a percentage of all tokens consumed based on your Creator Epoch—up to 33% for early creators. This isn't a one-time payment—it's continuous passive income for as long as your creations remain useful.

Tokens distributed immediately after each action execution

<Card title="No Maintenance" icon="infinity">

Once published, workflows earn automatically without updates

<Card title="Global Scale" icon="earth-americas">

Your creations can be used by millions worldwide

## How Marketplace Earnings Work

### The Distribution Flow

<Frame caption="Marketplace Token Flow - From Action to Creator Wallet">
  <img src="/images/marketplace-token-flow.png" alt="Marketplace Token Distribution" />
</Frame>

<Steps>
<Step title="User Executes Workflow">

A business or individual runs your workflow through the marketplace

</Step>

<Step title="Actions Consume Tokens">

Each GUI action in your workflow consumes $LAM tokens

</Step>

<Step title="Automatic Distribution">

Your Creator Epoch percentage (max 33%) of consumed tokens instantly credited to your wallet

</Step>

<Step title="Compound Growth">

More users discover and use your workflow, multiplying earnings

</Step>
</Steps>

## Creator Epochs: Time-Based Reward Tiers

### Early Creator Advantage

<Info>

**Forever Locked Rewards**: When you publish a workflow to the marketplace, it gets tagged with the current Creator Epoch. This determines your permanent reward percentage from the token distribution—forever. A workflow published in Month 1 earns the full 33% of consumed tokens in perpetuity, while Month 9 workflows only earn 5%.

</Info>

</Frame>

### Creator Epoch Reward Schedule

| Creator Epoch | Publishing Month | Marketplace Reward % | Status |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------|---------|
| **Epoch 1** | Month 1 | **33%** | Maximum Reward |
| **Epoch 2** | Month 2 | **25%** | Early Creator |
| **Epoch 3** | Month 3 | **20%** | Pioneer |
| **Epoch 4** | Month 4 | **17.5%** | Advanced |
| **Epoch 5** | Month 5 | **15%** | Established |
| **Epoch 6** | Month 6 | **12.5%** | Growing |
| **Epoch 7** | Month 7 | **10%** | Standard |
| **Epoch 8** | Month 8 | **7.5%** | Reduced |
| **Epoch 9** | Month 9 | **5%** | Minimal |
| **Epoch 10+** | Month 10+ | **5%** | Base Rate |

<Note>

**Key Difference**: Creator Epochs determine your percentage of the 33% creator distribution. Training epochs (found in [Point Tiers and Epochs](/tokenomics/point-tiers-and-epochs)) multiply your training rewards.

</Note>

### How Creator Epochs Work

<Steps>
<Step title="Create Workflow">

Build and test your automation workflow using the Actionist desktop app

</Step>

<Step title="Publish to Marketplace">

Submit your workflow for review and marketplace listing

</Step>

<Step title="Epoch Tagging">

Your workflow gets permanently tagged with the current Creator Epoch (e.g., "Epoch 2")

</Step>

<Step title="Earn Forever">

Every time someone uses your workflow, you earn the locked-in percentage from token consumption

</Step>

<Step title="Compound Earnings">

Create multiple workflows across different epochs to diversify your reward rates

</Step>
</Steps>

### Creator Epoch Examples

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Month 1 Creator Success Story">

**Scenario**: Published "LinkedIn Job Application" workflow in Month 1<br/>
<br/>
**Creator Epoch**: 1 (33% reward rate)<br/>
<br/>
**Monthly Usage**: 10,000 executions consuming 500,000 tokens<br/>
<br/>
**Monthly Earnings**: 500,000 × 0.33 = **165,000 $LAM tokens**<br/>
<br/>
**Annual Projection**: 165,000 × 12 = **1,980,000 $LAM tokens**<br/>
<br/>
**Why It Matters**: This same workflow published in Month 9 would only earn 5% (75,750 tokens annually) - 96% less income!

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Month 4 Creator Strategy">

**Scenario**: Published "AWS Server Setup" workflow in Month 4<br/>
<br/>
**Creator Epoch**: 4 (17.5% reward rate)<br/>
<br/>
**Monthly Usage**: 5,000 executions consuming 1,000,000 tokens<br/>
<br/>
**Monthly Earnings**: 1,000,000 × 0.175 = **175,000 $LAM tokens**<br/>
<br/>
**Comparison**: Same usage in Month 1 would earn 330,000 tokens (88% more)

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Portfolio Strategy">

**Scenario**: Creator publishes workflows across multiple epochs<br/>
<br/>
**Portfolio**:<br/>
- Month 1: "Email Automation" (33% rate) → 50,000 tokens/month<br/>
- Month 3: "Social Media Manager" (20% rate) → 80,000 tokens/month<br/>
- Month 6: "Data Entry Bot" (12.5% rate) → 25,000 tokens/month<br/>
<br/>
**Total Monthly Earnings**: **155,000 $LAM tokens**<br/>
<br/>
**Key Insight**: Diversifying across epochs provides income stability and maximizes early-mover advantage

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>

**Creator Window Closing**: The gap between Month 1 (33%) and Month 10+ (5%) represents a 560% difference in lifetime earnings. Early creators don't just earn more—they earn exponentially more, forever.

</Warning>

## Revenue Share Breakdown

### Where Every Token Goes

<Info>

**The Perfect Split**: 34% burned (creating scarcity), 33% to creators (rewarding innovation), 33% to foundation (ensuring sustainability). This balance drives both token value and creator incentive.

</Info>

### Per-Action Token Distribution

| Recipient | Percentage | Purpose | Impact |
|-----------|------------|---------|---------|
| **Burned** | 34% | Permanently removed | Increases scarcity |
| **Creator** | 33% | Workflow/agent author | Incentivizes quality |
| **Foundation** | 33% | Platform operations | Ensures growth |

<Note>

**Important**: If a workflow uses other marketplace components, the 33% creator share is split proportionally among all contributors based on their action contribution. The actual percentage you receive depends on your Creator Epoch (see above).
