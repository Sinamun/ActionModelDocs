<Note>

**The Creator Revolution**: For the first time in AI history, those who build the automations earn from their usage. Every workflow you publish, every agent you create, generates continuous income as others leverage your innovation.

</Note>

## The 33% Creator Economy

### Your Automations, Your Revenue Stream

When any workflow or agent you've created is used through the marketplace, you automatically receive 33% of all tokens consumed. This isn't a one-time payment—it's continuous passive income for as long as your creations remain useful.

## Revenue Share Breakdown

### Where Every Token Goes

<Info>

**The Perfect Split**: 34% burned (creating scarcity), 33% to creators (rewarding innovation), 33% to foundation (ensuring sustainability). This balance drives both token value and creator incentive.

</Info>

### Per-Action Token Distribution

| Recipient | Percentage | Purpose | Impact |
|-----------|------------|---------|---------|
| **Burned** | 34% | Permanently removed | Increases scarcity |
| **Creator** | 33% | Workflow/agent author | Incentivizes quality |
| **Foundation** | 33% | Platform operations | Ensures growth |

<Note>

**Important**: If a workflow uses other marketplace components, the 33% creator share is split proportionally among all contributors based on their action contribution.
