# Build the Future of Automation for Your Clients

Partnering with Action Model allows you to leverage universal GUI LAM's to provide powerful, future-proof automation solutions. As businesses prepare to invest tens of thousands of dollars for truly autonomous AI Agents, you can be on the front lines, building and deploying these solutions today.

## The Next Wave of Automation is Here

For years, the automation landscape has been dominated by workflow editors like Zapier, Make, and N8N. These tools are useful, but they share a fundamental limitation: they rely on APIs. Less than 0.1% of the world's software functionality is exposed via stable, public APIs.

The real work happens in Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)—and that's where Action Model operates. Our LAMs interact with websites and desktop apps just like a human does, unlocking automation for the other 99.9% of digital work.

<Info>
**The Market Shift:** Thousands of agencies and consultants have built businesses on API-based workflow editors. The future belongs to those who can master Action-based AI models that operate directly on the user interface, delivering far more robust and comprehensive automation.
