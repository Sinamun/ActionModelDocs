<Warning>

**The Gold Rush is Happening Now**: While others browse Facebook for 1x rewards, smart trainers are earning 73x on enterprise platforms. The bounty system isn't random—it's a strategic map showing exactly where the future of automation is being built.

</Warning>

## Understanding the Bounty System

The Action Model Bounty System is a **dynamic reward mechanism** that directs community training efforts toward the most commercially valuable platforms. Think of it as a heat map of the automation economy—the higher the bounty, the more businesses need that automation.

## The Commercial Value Formula

### Why Business Platforms Pay More

<Info>

**The &#36;10,000/Month Reality Check**: Most businesses spend &#36;5,000-15,000 monthly on agencies to manage their Facebook Ads. With Actionist automating these same tasks for &#36;100/month in &#36;LAM tokens, that's a 95-99% cost reduction. This massive value gap is exactly why ads.facebook.com has a 6x multiplier while regular Facebook has only 1x.

</Info>

Let's explore a real example that perfectly illustrates how commercial value drives bounty multipliers:

### Case Study: Facebook Ecosystem Bounties

<Steps>
<Step title="Step 1: Search for Platform">

When trainers search for "facebook" in the bounty engine, they discover a goldmine of opportunity, but not all Facebook platforms are created equal:

<Frame caption="Searching 'facebook' reveals vastly different bounty multipliers across the ecosystem">
  <img src="/marketplace/images/bounties-facebook.png" alt="Facebook bounties search results" />
</Frame>

Notice the dramatic differences:
- **business.facebook.com**: x7.44 multiplier
- **developers.facebook.com**: x6.54 multiplier  
- **ads.facebook.com**: x6.08 multiplier
- **m.facebook.com**: x1.25 multiplier
- **facebook.com**: x1.22 multiplier

</Step>

<Step title="Step 2: High-Value Business Platform">

Click on **ads.facebook.com** and you'll understand why it commands a 6x multiplier:

<Frame caption="ads.facebook.com offers x6.08 multiplier due to massive commercial value">
  <img src="/marketplace/images/adsfacebookcom.png" alt="Facebook Ads Manager high bounty details" />
</Frame>

**Why ads.facebook.com is worth 6x more:**
- Businesses spend billions on Facebook advertising annually
- Manual campaign management costs &#36;50-200/hour for specialists
- Agencies charge &#36;3,000-20,000/month for ad management
- Actionist can automate 80% of these tasks instantly
- Direct ROI impact on business revenue

</Step>

<Step title="Step 3: Low-Value Consumer Platform">

Compare this to regular **facebook.com** with only a 1.22x multiplier:

<Frame caption="facebook.com has minimal bounty as it lacks commercial automation value">
  <img src="/marketplace/images/facebookcom.png" alt="Regular Facebook low bounty details" />
</Frame>

**Why facebook.com has low bounty:**
- Personal social media has limited business value
- No direct revenue generation
- Simple actions that don't save significant money
- Businesses don't hire people to browse Facebook
- Consumer activities vs. commercial operations

</Step>
</Steps>

### The Value Calculation Breakdown

### Understanding the Multiplier Impact

<Tabs>
<Tab title="For Trainers" icon="user-graduate">

**Your Earnings Amplified**

Training on high-commercial-value platforms means:
- Every workflow you create on ads.facebook.com earns 6x more
- 10 workflows on ads platform = 60 workflows on regular Facebook
- Focus your time where businesses spend their money
- Build expertise in platforms that companies desperately need automated

<Warning>

**Smart Training Strategy**: One hour training ads.facebook.com (6.08x) equals six hours training regular Facebook (1.22x). Choose your platforms wisely.

</Warning>
