<Warning>

**The Gold Rush is Happening Now**: While others browse Facebook for 1x rewards, smart trainers are earning 73x on enterprise platforms. The bounty system isn't random—it's a strategic map showing exactly where the future of automation is being built.

## Understanding the Bounty System

The Action Model Bounty System is a **dynamic reward mechanism** that directs community training efforts toward the most commercially valuable platforms. Think of it as a heat map of the automation economy—the higher the bounty, the more businesses need that automation.
