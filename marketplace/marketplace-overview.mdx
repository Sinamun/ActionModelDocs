</Frame>
<br/>

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Example: Stripe Workflows - Replace Your Payment Operations Team">

**The Actionist Way:** Marketplace Stripe workflows automate everything your payment team does:
- **Create support tickets** for billing issues automatically
- **Manage accounts** without manual intervention
- **Automate ticket routing** based on issue categories
- **Set up notifications** for payment events
- **Handle refunds and disputes** with predefined rules
- **Generate reports** on demand

## The Economic Model

### How Everyone Wins

<Info>

**The Revolutionary Model**: Every workflow execution consumes &#36;LAM tokens as fuel. A portion goes directly to the creator, incentivizing quality and innovation. This isn't charity, it's ownership.

</Info>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Token Flow" icon="coins">

### Where Your &#36;LAM Goes

When an action consumes tokens, they are distributed as follows:

| Recipient | Distribution | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Builder Rewards** | 33% | Direct to workflow creators ([Learn more](/marketplace/revenue-generation)) |
| **Burn Mechanism** | 34% | Permanently removed from circulation ([Learn more](/tokenomics/token-utility)) |
| **Ecosystem** | 33% | Platform operations and development ([Learn more](/tokenomics/token-utility)) |

<Note>

**Creator Epoch Matters**: The actual creator percentage varies by when workflows are published. Month 1 creators earn the full 33%, while Month 10+ creators earn only 5% of consumed tokens. [See Creator Epoch schedule](/tokenomics/marketplace-distributions#creator-epochs-time-based-reward-tiers).

</Note>

</Tab>
<Tab title="Value Creation" icon="chart-line">

### The Virtuous Cycle

<Steps>
<Step title="Business Usage">

Enterprises pay &#36;1,000-2,000/month per AI agent

</Step>

<Step title="Token Demand">

Platform uses subscription revenue to buy &#36;LAM from market

</Step>

<Step title="Action Execution">

AI agents consume &#36;LAM tokens as fuel (&#36;0.01 per action for LAM-1)

</Step>

<Step title="Token Distribution">

33% to creators, 34% burned forever, 33% to ecosystem

</Step>

<Step title="Supply Reduction">

Burning permanently reduces total supply, creating scarcity

</Step>

<Step title="Value Appreciation">

Decreased supply + continued demand = price appreciation

</Step>
</Steps>

</Tab>
<Tab title="Real Examples" icon="calculator">

### Token Consumption Examples

**Simple Email Automation (50 actions):**
- Tokens consumed: 50 (at &#36;0.01 token price)
- Creator earns: Up to 16.5 tokens (33%)
- Burned forever: 17 tokens (34%)
- Ecosystem: 16.5 tokens (33%)
- Total cost: &#36;0.50

**Social Media Management (150 actions):**
- Tokens consumed: 150 (at &#36;0.01 token price)
- Creator earns: Up to 49.5 tokens (33%)
- Burned forever: 51 tokens (34%)
- Ecosystem: 49.5 tokens (33%)
- Total cost: &#36;1.50

**Enterprise Data Processing (2,000 actions):**
- Tokens consumed: 2,000 (at &#36;0.01 token price)
- Creator earns: Up to 660 tokens (33%)
- Burned forever: 680 tokens (34%)
- Ecosystem: 660 tokens (33%)
- Total cost: &#36;20.00

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Dynamic Pricing Model

<Info>

**Price Stability for Businesses**: The USD cost per action is fixed by LAM version (e.g., LAM-1 = &#36;0.01/action), while the number of tokens consumed adjusts with market price. This gives businesses predictable costs while allowing token value to appreciate.

</Info>

**How it Works:**
- **Fixed USD price**: &#36;0.01 per action (LAM-1)
- **Floating token cost**: Adjusts based on &#36;LAM market price
- **Example**: If &#36;LAM = &#36;0.001, then 10 tokens per action. If &#36;LAM = &#36;0.10, then 0.1 tokens per action
- **Business benefit**: Predictable budgeting in USD
- **Holder benefit**: Fewer tokens needed as price increases
