title: "Marketplace Overview"
description: "The world's first community-owned automation marketplace. Browse thousands of workflows, deploy AI agents, and earn from your creations - all powered by the community, for the community."
---

<Note>

**The Revolution Has a Marketplace**: While Big Tech locks their automation behind closed doors, we're building an open economy where every workflow creator becomes an owner. This isn't just a marketplace—it's the foundation of the community-owned AI future.

</Note>

## Welcome to the Automation Economy

The Action Model Marketplace is where **creators build the future** and **users deploy it instantly**. Unlike traditional automation platforms that keep all the value for themselves, every workflow published here generates revenue for its creator through the $LAM token economy.

|--------|------------------|-------------|
| **Workflow Execution** | 30% | Creator |
| **Workflow Execution** | 10% | Marketplace Pool |

## Why This Changes Everything

<Warning>

**The Old Way**: Zapier charges $599/month for automation. Make.com charges $499/month. You own nothing. They own everything.

**The Action Model Way**: Free to browse. Pay only for what you use in $LAM. Creators earn. Users save. Everyone owns a piece.

</Warning>

## Join the Revolution

<Info>

The marketplace isn't just about buying and selling workflows—it's about building the world's first community-owned automation infrastructure. Every workflow published, every execution run, every token earned is a vote against Big Tech's monopoly.

**You're not just a user. You're an owner.**
