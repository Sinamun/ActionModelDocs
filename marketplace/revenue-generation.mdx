<Note>

**From Side Hustle to Empire**: Top creators are earning &#36;47,000+ per month. Not from selling courses. Not from consulting. From workflows that work while they sleep. This is the new creator economy, and you own a piece of it.

</Note>

<Warning>

**Early Creator Advantage**: The platform is launching with [Creator Epochs](/tokenomics/point-tiers-and-epochs#creator-epochs-permanent-marketplace-rewards) that lock in higher earning percentages for early builders. Once these epochs pass, they're gone forever. The creators joining today will earn significantly more per workflow than those joining in 6 months.

</Warning>

## The Four Revenue Streams

The Action Model Marketplace offers multiple paths to monetization, each designed to reward different types of contribution and expertise levels.

## Commission Structure Deep Dive

### Understanding Your Earnings

<Info>

**The Math Behind the Money**: Every workflow execution consumes &#36;LAM tokens as fuel. You get a percentage of every token consumed. More usage = More earnings. It's that simple.

</Info>

### Token Distribution Per Execution

Every &#36;LAM token consumed is distributed according to our tokenomics model:

| Recipient | Distribution | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Builder Rewards** | 33% | Direct to workflow creators based on [Creator Epoch](/tokenomics/point-tiers-and-epochs#creator-epochs-permanent-marketplace-rewards) |
| **Burn Mechanism** | 34% | Permanently removed from circulation to increase token value |
| **Ecosystem** | 33% | Platform operations, development, and growth initiatives |

### Earnings Calculator


**Quick Math Examples**:
- 1 workflow, 100 daily executions = ~3,000 &#36;LAM/month
- 10 workflows, 50 daily each = ~15,000 &#36;LAM/month
- 1 premium agent, 10 businesses = ~10,000 &#36;LAM/month
- Mix of all streams = 50,000+ &#36;LAM/month possible
