<Note>

**From Side Hustle to Empire**: Top creators are earning $47,000+ per month. Not from selling courses. Not from consulting. From workflows that work while they sleep. This is the new creator economy—and you own a piece of it.

</Note>

## The Four Revenue Streams

The Action Model Marketplace offers multiple paths to monetization, each designed to reward different types of contribution and expertise levels.

## Commission Structure Deep Dive

### Understanding Your Earnings

<Info>

**The Math Behind the Money**: Every workflow execution consumes $LAM tokens as fuel. You get a percentage of every token consumed. More usage = More earnings. It's that simple.

</Info>

### Token Distribution Per Execution

| Recipient | Base Rate | Verified Creator | Partner Creator |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Creator** | 30% | 35% | 40% |
| **Platform** | 40% | 37.5% | 35% |
| **Burn** | 20% | 20% | 20% |
| **Treasury** | 10% | 7.5% | 5% |

**Quick Math Examples**:
- 1 workflow, 100 daily executions = ~3,000 $LAM/month
- 10 workflows, 50 daily each = ~15,000 $LAM/month
- 1 premium agent, 10 businesses = ~10,000 $LAM/month
- Mix of all streams = 50,000+ $LAM/month possible
