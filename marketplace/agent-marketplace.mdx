description: "Deploy complete AI employees instantly. Browse pre-configured agents with personalities, memories, and workflows ready to transform your business operations."

<Note>

**Beyond Workflows: Complete Digital Employees**: While workflows automate tasks, agents are complete AI employees with personalities, memories, schedules, and the ability to make decisions. This is the difference between a tool and a team member.

</Note>

## The Evolution from Workflows to Agents

Agents represent the next level of automation—not just executing tasks, but understanding context, learning preferences, and working autonomously like a real employee. The Agent Marketplace is where businesses find their perfect AI workforce.

## FAQs About Agents

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How are agents different from ChatGPT or Claude?">

ChatGPT and Claude generate text. Agents actually DO things—they click, type, navigate, and complete tasks on real websites and applications. They're workers, not advisors.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can agents work with my existing tools?">

Yes! Agents work with any software accessible via GUI. They don't need APIs or integrations—if a human can use it, an agent can too.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if an agent makes a mistake?">

All agents have error handling and can be configured with human checkpoints for critical decisions. You can also review all actions in the history log.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I customize purchased agents?">

Most agents allow configuration of variables, schedules, and preferences. For deeper customization, consider white-label licensing.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do agents work 24/7?">

Yes, when deployed on Cloud VPC. Desktop agents work when your computer is on. Cloud agents never stop.
