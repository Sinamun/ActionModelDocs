## The Evolution Beyond Traditional Automation

Forget everything you know about automation tools. Zapier, Make.com, n8n—they're all built for developers, excluding 99% of the population with their technical complexity.

Actionist workflows are different. They're written in **human language**. If you can describe a task to a colleague, you can create a workflow.

<Warning>

**The Paradigm Shift**: Traditional automation tools connect APIs. Actionist controls interfaces. This means it can automate literally anything you can do on a computer—no integration required.

</Warning>

## Understanding Agents

### Your Digital Workforce

Agents are specialized AI employees, each with a specific role and personality. Think of them as digital team members who:

- **Have defined roles**: Marketing Agent, Sales Agent, HR Agent
- **Learn your style**: Adapt to your preferences and workflows
- **Work autonomously**: Execute tasks without constant supervision
- **Collaborate**: Pass work between each other via Chains

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Marketing Agent" icon="megaphone">

## Workflows: The Building Blocks

### Anatomy of a Workflow

Every workflow consists of core components that work together to automate any task:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Variables">

**Dynamic inputs that make workflows flexible**

Variables are placeholders for information that changes each time a workflow runs:
- User-provided inputs (e.g., "email_subject", "target_audience")
- Data gathered from screens (e.g., "product_price", "customer_name")
- Values passed from other workflows in a chain
- Environmental variables (e.g., "current_date", "user_timezone")

Example:
```
video_prompt = "Create a 30-second video about {topic}"
email_list = "{csv_file_path}"
budget_limit = "{max_spend}"
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Workflow Steps">

**Human-readable instructions for task execution**

Steps are written in plain English, describing exactly what the agent should do:

1. Open Chrome browser
2. Navigate to LinkedIn.com
3. Search for "{job_title}" in "{location}"
4. Filter results by "posted in last 24 hours"
5. For each job posting:
   - Extract company name and job requirements
   - Save to spreadsheet
6. Send summary email with top 10 matches

No code. No technical jargon. Just clear instructions.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Rules">

**Constraints and conditions that guide execution**

Rules ensure the workflow behaves correctly:
- "Only process emails from verified senders"
- "Stop if budget exceeds $1000"
- "Skip weekends and holidays"
- "Use formal tone for enterprise clients"
- "Prioritize urgent tickets first"

Rules can include:
- IF/THEN conditions
- Loops and iterations
- Error handling
- Success criteria

</Tab>
<Tab title="Human Confirmation">

**Checkpoints requiring human oversight**

Critical decisions can require human approval:
- "Confirm before sending campaign to 10,000+ contacts"
- "Review generated content before publishing"
- "Approve purchases over $500"
- "Verify candidate selection before sending offer"

The agent will:
1. Pause execution
2. Send notification (chat, Telegram, WhatsApp)
3. Wait for human response
4. Continue based on input

**Autopilot Mode**: Can be enabled to bypass all confirmations (use with caution!)

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Success Conditions

Every workflow needs to know when it's done:
- **Goal Achievement**: "All emails sent successfully"
- **Time Limit**: "Stop after 2 hours"
- **Quantity**: "Process 100 records"
- **Condition Met**: "Found matching candidate"

## Creating Workflows

### Method 1: Screen Recording (Simplest)

The easiest way to create a workflow—just show Actionist what to do:

<Steps>
<Step title="Start Recording">

Click the record button in Actionist

</Step>

<Step title="Perform Your Task">

Do the task normally on your computer while Actionist watches

</Step>

<Step title="Add Annotations">

While recording, use the annotation tools:
- **Variable**: Click to mark dynamic fields that change
- **Rule**: Highlight important conditions or decisions
- **Ask Human**: Mark points needing confirmation

</Step>

<Step title="Stop and Save">

Actionist automatically generates a complete workflow from your recording

</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>

**Magic Translation**: Actionist converts your recorded actions into human-readable steps, making it easy to understand and modify later.

</Info>

### Method 2: Visual Workflow Editor

For more complex automations, use the visual editor:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Node-Based Design" icon="diagram-project">

Drag and drop nodes to build workflows visually

</Card>

<Card title="Advanced Logic" icon="code-branch">

Add branches, loops, conditions, and error handling

</Card>
</CardGroup>

**Available Nodes:**
- **Action**: Click, type, navigate
- **Decision**: IF/THEN branches
- **Loop**: Repeat actions
- **Wait**: Pause for conditions
- **Merge**: Combine branches
- **Error**: Handle failures
- **Human**: Request input
- **Chain**: Link to other workflows

### Method 3: Import from Marketplace

Why reinvent the wheel? Import proven workflows:

1. Browse the [Marketplace](/marketplace/marketplace-overview)
2. Find workflows for your platform/use case
3. Click "Add to My Workflows"
4. Customize variables for your needs
5. Start using immediately

<Tip>

**Earn from Sharing**: When you create a great workflow, publish it to the marketplace. You earn tokens every time someone uses it!

</Tip>

## Advanced Workflow Features

### Loops and Iterations

Automate repetitive tasks with intelligent loops:

```
FOR EACH item in spreadsheet:
  1. Copy item details
  2. Search for item on supplier website
  3. Extract price and availability
  4. Update spreadsheet with information
  5. Move to next item
END LOOP
```

### Conditional Logic

Make smart decisions during execution:

```
IF email contains "urgent":
  - Flag as high priority
  - Send immediate notification
ELSE IF email from VIP client:
  - Assign to senior team
  - Send acknowledgment within 1 hour
ELSE:
  - Add to regular queue
  - Process within 24 hours
```

### Error Handling

Gracefully handle unexpected situations:

```
TRY:
  - Complete purchase on website
IF ERROR:
  - Take screenshot of error
  - Try alternative payment method
  - If still fails, notify human
  - Log error for analysis
```

## Chains: Orchestrating Complex Automation

### Linking Workflows Together

Chains connect multiple workflows to automate entire business processes:

<Steps>
<Step title="Workflow 1: Lead Generation">

- Scrape LinkedIn for prospects
- Output: CSV of qualified leads

</Step>

<Step title="Workflow 2: Enrichment">

- Takes CSV from Workflow 1
- Finds email addresses and company info
- Output: Enriched lead database

</Step>

<Step title="Workflow 3: Outreach">

- Takes enriched database from Workflow 2
- Sends personalized email sequences
- Output: Campaign report

</Step>

<Step title="Workflow 4: Follow-up">

- Monitors responses from Workflow 3
- Schedules meetings for interested prospects
- Updates CRM with all activities

</Step>
</Steps>

### Variable Mapping

Chains pass data between workflows seamlessly:
- Workflow A outputs `customer_list`
- Workflow B receives it as `import_data`
- No manual intervention required

## Memory Integration

### How Memories Enhance Workflows

Memories provide persistent context that makes workflows smarter:

- **Platform Knowledge**: "In Gmail, the compose button is in the top left"
- **Preferences**: "Always use British spelling for UK clients"
- **Relationships**: "Project Alpha data is stored in Drive folder X"
- **Business Context**: "Our fiscal year ends in March"

## History and Learning

### Continuous Improvement

Every workflow execution is logged, creating a feedback loop:

1. **Execution Tracking**: See what worked and what didn't
2. **Pattern Recognition**: AI learns from repeated tasks
3. **Optimization**: Workflows become more efficient over time
4. **Context Building**: Past executions inform future decisions

## Calendar and Scheduling

### Automation on Autopilot

Schedule workflows to run automatically:
- **One-time**: Run once at a specific date/time
- **Recurring**: Daily, weekly, monthly patterns
- **Triggered**: Based on events or conditions
- **Continuous**: Run for X hours per day
