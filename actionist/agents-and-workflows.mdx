<Note>

**No Code. No APIs. Just Human Language.** While Zapier, n8n, and Make.com built tools for developers, we built Actionist for humans. If you can describe a task to a colleague, you can create a workflow.

### Transform Natural Language into Visual Workflows Instantly

The Actionist AI Workflow Generator revolutionizes automation creation by converting simple text prompts into sophisticated visual workflows. Just describe what you want to automate in plain English, and watch as our AI builds a complete workflow that you can immediately use or customize.

### How It Works

<Steps>
<Step title="Enter Your Workflow Prompt">

Simply type what you want to automate in natural language:
- "Check my emails every morning and create tasks in Notion for important items"
- "Monitor competitor prices and update my Shopify store automatically"
- "Extract data from invoices and enter into QuickBooks"

No technical knowledge required - just describe your goal.

</Step>

<Step title="AI Generates Visual Workflow">

Within seconds, Actionist AI creates a complete visual workflow:
- **Smart Node Creation**: Automatically identifies all required actions and tools
- **Logical Flow Design**: Connects nodes in the optimal sequence
- **Conditional Logic**: Adds decision points and branching where needed
- **Error Handling**: Includes fallback paths and retry mechanisms

</Step>

<Step title="Visual Workflow Editor Opens">

Your generated workflow appears in our intuitive visual editor (similar to n8n):
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Easily rearrange nodes and connections
- **Real-Time Preview**: See data flow through your workflow
- **Node Configuration**: Click any node to adjust settings
- **Test Mode**: Run workflows step-by-step to verify behavior

</Step>

<Step title="Customize and Perfect">

Fine-tune the AI-generated workflow to your exact needs:
- **Add/Remove Nodes**: Insert additional actions or remove unnecessary steps
- **Adjust Parameters**: Modify timing, conditions, and data mappings
- **Connect More Apps**: Integrate with 1000+ applications
- **Set Schedules**: Configure when and how often workflows run

</Step>
</Steps>

### Revolutionary Advantages Over Traditional Platforms

<Warning>

**The Game Changer**: While n8n, Zapier, and Make.com are limited to API integrations, Actionist operates at the OS level—it can automate ANYTHING you can do on your computer, with zero technical complexity.

</Warning>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="OS-Level Control" icon="desktop">

**No API? No Problem!**

Unlike competitors limited to apps with APIs, Actionist controls your entire computer—clicking, typing, and navigating any application or website. Automate legacy software, internal tools, or any GUI application.

</Card>

<Card title="Zero Data Mapping" icon="magic">

**No JSON, No Field Mapping, No Complexity**

Forget about mapping data fields between nodes or understanding JSON structures. Actionist intelligently passes data between actions without any manual configuration. What takes hours in Zapier takes minutes here.

</Card>

<Card title="Built for Everyone" icon="users">

**Non-Technical Users Welcome**

No coding, no API keys, no webhooks to configure. If you can describe what you want, Actionist can build it. Your grandmother could create workflows that would challenge a Zapier expert.

</Card>

<Card title="Hybrid Power" icon="layer-group">

**Best of Both Worlds**

Combine OS-level automation with API integrations and MCP servers. Start with visual automation, then add APIs for speed where available—something impossible with traditional platforms.

- ❌ Different integration for each app
- ❌ Can't handle visual elements

**Actionist Workflow Engine**:
- ✅ Automates ANYTHING on your screen
- ✅ Zero data mapping—it just flows
- ✅ Works with any software, any website
- ✅ Visual automation anyone can understand
- ✅ One approach works everywhere
- ✅ Sees and interacts like a human
- ✅ Combines OS control with APIs when needed

#### Real-World Impact

<Tabs>
<Tab title="🎯 Simple Example">

**Workflow:** Daily LinkedIn Engagement

```
1. Open LinkedIn
2. Go to home feed
3. Find posts about "AI" or "automation"

## Workflow Configuration Deep Dive

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Variables" icon="brackets-square">

### Dynamic Inputs for Flexibility

Variables make workflows reusable and powerful:

<CodeGroup>
```yaml Basic Variables
email_subject: "Weekly Report"
recipient_list: "team@company.com"
report_date: "{today}"
priority_level: "high"
```

```yaml Advanced Variables
customer_segments: ["enterprise", "SMB", "startup"]
price_threshold: 1000
discount_percentage: 15
approval_required: true
escalation_email: "manager@company.com"
```
</CodeGroup>

**Variable Types:**
- **Text**: Names, descriptions, messages
- **Numbers**: Quantities, prices, thresholds
- **Dates**: Deadlines, schedules, ranges
- **Lists**: Multiple items, categories
- **Booleans**: Yes/no decisions
- **Files**: Paths, attachments, uploads

</Tab>
<Tab title="Steps" icon="list-check">

### Human-Readable Instructions

Write steps like you're explaining to a colleague:

<CodeGroup>
```text Simple Steps
1. Open Gmail
2. Click "Compose"
3. Enter recipient email
4. Type subject line
5. Write message body
6. Click "Send"
```

```text Complex Steps with Logic
1. Open CRM dashboard
2. Navigate to "Leads" section
3. Filter by "Last 7 days"
4. FOR EACH lead in list:
   a. Check lead score
   b. IF score > 80:
      - Mark as "Hot Lead"
      - Assign to senior sales
   c. ELSE IF score > 50:
      - Mark as "Warm Lead"
      - Add to nurture campaign
   d. ELSE:
      - Mark as "Cold Lead"
      - Schedule follow-up in 30 days
5. Export results to CSV
6. Email report to sales manager
```
</CodeGroup>

</Tab>
<Tab title="Rules" icon="gavel">

### Constraints and Conditions

Rules ensure workflows behave correctly:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Business Rules">

- Only process during business hours (9 AM - 6 PM)
- Skip weekends and holidays
- Respect rate limits (max 100 emails/hour)
- Stay within budget constraints

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Quality Rules">

- Verify data before processing
- Check for duplicates
- Validate email formats
- Ensure required fields are filled

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Safety Rules">

- Get approval for amounts > $1000
- Confirm before bulk operations
- Create backups before modifications
- Log all critical actions

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

</Tab>
<Tab title="Human Checkpoints" icon="user-check">

### When to Require Confirmation

Strategic points for human oversight:

<Warning>

**Critical Actions Always Need Confirmation:**
- Financial transactions
- Mass communications (>100 recipients)
- Data deletion
- Contract agreements
- Hiring decisions

</Warning>

**How It Works:**
1. Workflow reaches checkpoint
2. Agent pauses execution
3. Sends notification (App, Telegram, WhatsApp, Email)
4. Waits for human response
5. Continues based on input

**Autopilot Mode:** Can bypass confirmations for trusted workflows (use carefully!)
