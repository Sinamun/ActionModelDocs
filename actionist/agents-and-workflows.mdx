title: "Agents and Workflows"
description: "Master the art of creating AI employees and automations. Build agents with specific roles and workflows that execute complex tasks in human language, no coding required."

<Note>

**No Code. No APIs. Just Human Language.** While Zapier, n8n, and Make.com built tools for developers, we built Actionist for humans. If you can describe a task to a colleague, you can create a workflow.

## What Are Agents?

<Info>

**Think of Agents as Digital Employees**: Each agent is a specialized AI team member with a specific role, personality, and set of skills. They work 24/7, never need breaks, and get smarter with every task they complete.

Workflows are the **individual tasks** that agents perform. Think of them as detailed instructions written in plain English that tell your agent exactly what to do.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="ðŸŽ¯ Simple Example">

**Workflow:** Daily LinkedIn Engagement

```
1. Open LinkedIn
2. Go to home feed
3. Find posts about "AI" or "automation"
4. Leave thoughtful comment on each post
5. Connect with other commenters
6. Log engagement in spreadsheet
```

Time to create: **2 minutes**
Time saved daily: **2 hours**

</Tab>
<Tab title="ðŸš€ Advanced Example">

**Workflow:** Complete Sales Pipeline

```

  <img src="/images/visual-workflow-builder.png" alt="Visual Workflow Builder Interface" />
</Frame>

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Available Node Types" icon="shapes">

Drag and drop these nodes to build complex logic:

| Node Type | Purpose | Example Use |

| **Action** | Perform GUI actions | Click button, type text |
| **Decision** | Branching logic | IF price > $100 THEN... |
| **Loop** | Repeat actions | Process all items in list |
| **Wait** | Pause execution | Wait for page load |
| **Chain** | Link workflows | Start another workflow |
| **Human** | Get approval | Confirm before sending |
| **Error** | Handle failures | Retry or alert on error |

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Connecting Nodes" icon="link">

## Workflow Configuration Deep Dive

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Variables" icon="brackets-square">

### Dynamic Inputs for Flexibility

Variables make workflows reusable and powerful:

<CodeGroup>
```yaml Basic Variables
email_subject: "Weekly Report"
recipient_list: "team@company.com"
report_date: "{today}"
priority_level: "high"
```

```yaml Advanced Variables
customer_segments: ["enterprise", "SMB", "startup"]
price_threshold: 1000
discount_percentage: 15
approval_required: true
escalation_email: "manager@company.com"
```
</CodeGroup>

**Variable Types:**
- **Text**: Names, descriptions, messages
- **Numbers**: Quantities, prices, thresholds
- **Dates**: Deadlines, schedules, ranges
- **Lists**: Multiple items, categories
- **Booleans**: Yes/no decisions
- **Files**: Paths, attachments, uploads

</Tab>
<Tab title="Steps" icon="list-check">

### Human-Readable Instructions

Write steps like you're explaining to a colleague:

<CodeGroup>
```text Simple Steps
1. Open Gmail
2. Click "Compose"
3. Enter recipient email
4. Type subject line
5. Write message body
6. Click "Send"
```

```text Complex Steps with Logic
1. Open CRM dashboard
2. Navigate to "Leads" section
3. Filter by "Last 7 days"
4. FOR EACH lead in list:
   a. Check lead score
   b. IF score > 80:
      - Mark as "Hot Lead"
      - Assign to senior sales
   c. ELSE IF score > 50:
      - Mark as "Warm Lead"
      - Add to nurture campaign
   d. ELSE:
      - Mark as "Cold Lead"
      - Schedule follow-up in 30 days
5. Export results to CSV
6. Email report to sales manager
```
</CodeGroup>

</Tab>
<Tab title="Rules" icon="gavel">

### Constraints and Conditions

Rules ensure workflows behave correctly:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Business Rules">

- Only process during business hours (9 AM - 6 PM)
- Skip weekends and holidays
- Respect rate limits (max 100 emails/hour)
- Stay within budget constraints

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Quality Rules">

- Verify data before processing
- Check for duplicates
- Validate email formats
- Ensure required fields are filled

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Safety Rules">

- Get approval for amounts > $1000
- Confirm before bulk operations
- Create backups before modifications
- Log all critical actions

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

</Tab>
<Tab title="Human Checkpoints" icon="user-check">

### When to Require Confirmation

Strategic points for human oversight:

<Warning>

**Critical Actions Always Need Confirmation:**
- Financial transactions
- Mass communications (>100 recipients)
- Data deletion
- Contract agreements
- Hiring decisions

</Warning>

**How It Works:**
1. Workflow reaches checkpoint
2. Agent pauses execution
3. Sends notification (App, Telegram, WhatsApp, Email)
4. Waits for human response
5. Continues based on input

**Autopilot Mode:** Can bypass confirmations for trusted workflows (use carefully!)
