## Every Action, Recorded. Every Decision, Transparent.

Agent History transforms your AI workforce from a black box into a **glass box operation**. Every click, every decision, every data point is captured, searchable, and replayableâ€”giving you unprecedented visibility into your automation empire.

<Warning>

**The Trust Factor**: Unlike traditional automation that runs invisibly, Agent History provides complete transparency and accountability for every automated action, building trust with stakeholders and ensuring compliance.
