title: "Cloud VPC"
description: "Deploy unlimited AI agents in the cloud. Run 24/7 automation without sacrificing your computer. Scale from one agent to hundreds with enterprise-grade cloud infrastructure."

<Warning>

**The Limitation of Desktop Automation**: When Actionist runs on your local machine, it controls your mouse and keyboard‚Äîmeaning you can't use your computer. Cloud VPC solves this by giving each agent its own dedicated cloud computer.

</Warning>

## Your AI Workforce in the Cloud

Cloud VPC (Virtual Private Computer) transforms Actionist from a single desktop assistant into an **unlimited army of cloud-based AI employees**. Each agent gets its own Mac or Windows machine in the cloud, working 24/7 without ever touching your local computer.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I migrate from desktop to Cloud VPC?">

Yes! All workflows, agents, and memories seamlessly transfer from desktop to cloud. Simply export from desktop and import to your Cloud VPC.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if my agent encounters an error?">

Agents have built-in error recovery. If they can't resolve an issue, they'll pause, take a screenshot, notify you, and wait for instructions. You can then stream in to fix the issue manually.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can multiple agents work on the same task?">

Absolutely! You can deploy multiple agents working in parallel on different parts of the same project, dramatically reducing completion time.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is my data secure in the cloud?">

Yes. Each VPC is isolated, encrypted, and ephemeral. No data persists between sessions unless explicitly saved to your secure storage.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use my own software licenses?">

Yes. You can install and authenticate any software in your Cloud VPC, just like on a regular computer.

## üí° The Revolution Scales

<Warning>

**The Game-Changing Reality**: While Big Tech wants to sell you API-based automation that works with 0.1% of the internet, Cloud VPC gives you GUI-based automation that works with 100% of websites and applications‚Äîall running 24/7 in the cloud.

</Warning>

<Info>

**You're Not Just Scaling Automation**: Every Cloud VPC subscription converts fiat to $LAM tokens, creating constant buy pressure that benefits all token holders. Business adoption directly drives token value, rewarding the community that built this technology.
