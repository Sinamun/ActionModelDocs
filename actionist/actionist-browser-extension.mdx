## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>

The Action Model extension **collects data** to train the LAM. The Actionist extension **executes automations**. Think of it as training vs. doing.

</Accordion>

Yes, initially. The browser extension acts as a controller for your desktop app or Cloud VPC agents. Standalone browser automation is planned for 2026.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Will it slow down my browser?">

No. The extension is lightweight and only active when you engage with it. All heavy processing happens in your desktop app or cloud.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can it work with password-protected sites?">

Yes. Your credentials are securely stored in the Actionist app's encrypted memory and never exposed to the extension.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Will it work with my company's internal tools?">

Yes, as long as the desktop app can access them. The extension simply provides browser-based control.

</Accordion>
