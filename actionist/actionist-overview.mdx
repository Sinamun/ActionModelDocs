## Your AI Employee That Never Sleeps

There are **1 billion people** working behind computers worldwide, all using the same three tools: eyes to see the screen, hands to move the mouse, and fingers to type on keyboards.

Actionist is Action Model's flagship desktop application that does exactly what humans do - it sees your screen, controls your mouse, and types on your keyboard.

If a human can do it on a computer, **Actionist can automate it**.

## Deep Dive Into Core Features

### Agents: Your 24/7 Digital Employees

<Card>

<Frame>
  <img src="/actionist/images/agentintro.png" alt="Actionist Agents" />
</Frame>

**Transform departments with specialized AI workers**

Agents are the heart of Actionist, each one a digital employee with a specific role, personality, and expertise. Just like hiring for your team, you can create:

- **Marketing Agents**: Content creation, social media management, campaign execution
- **Sales Agents**: Lead qualification, CRM updates, follow-up sequences
- **HR Agents**: Resume screening, interview scheduling, onboarding
- **Operations Agents**: Data processing, report generation, system monitoring

Each agent can be customized with specific knowledge about your business, preferred communication style, and decision-making authority. They remember past interactions, learn from experience, and improve over time.

### Workflows and Marketplace

<Card>

<img src="/actionist/images/marketplace.png" alt="Actionist Workflows" />

**Build once, run forever**

Workflows are the specific tasks your agents execute. Think of them as detailed instructions that can be:

- **Recorded**: Simply perform the task once while Actionist watches
- **Imported**: Use pre-built workflows from the marketplace
- **Customized**: Modify existing workflows for your specific needs
- **Chained**: Connect multiple workflows for complex processes

Examples include posting to social media, processing invoices, updating spreadsheets, sending emails, or any repetitive task you currently do manually. The LAM ensures these workflows adapt when websites change, so they never break.

### Calendar: Smart Scheduling System

<Card>

<Frame>
  <img src="/actionist/images/calendar.png" alt="Actionist Calendar" />
</Frame>

**Your AI workforce runs on schedule**

Just like human employees, your agents work on schedules you define:

- **Recurring Tasks**: Daily reports, weekly summaries, monthly audits
- **Time-Based Triggers**: Market open, business hours, deadline reminders
- **Coordinated Workflows**: Multiple agents working in sequence
- **Timezone Management**: Global operations across time zones
- **Resource Optimization**: Prevent overlap and manage workload

The calendar system ensures your automations run exactly when needed, whether that's every morning at 9 AM or every time a specific event occurs.

<Card title="Configure Agent Schedules" icon="calendar" href="/actionist/agent-calendar-schedules">

Master scheduling, triggers, and coordinated workflows

</Card>

### Memory and Context

<Card>

<Frame>
  <img src="/actionist/images/memorycontext.png" alt="Actionist Memory" />
</Frame>

**Your agents never forget - and they learn from everything**

Memory and Context work together to make your agents truly intelligent:

**Persistent Memory:**
- **User Preferences**: Remember how you like things done
- **Platform Config**: Remember how you use your apps and platforms
- **Business Knowledge**: Custom information about your processes
- **Relationship Mapping**: Track connections between apps, platforms and data

**Intelligent Context from History:**
- **Cross-Platform Memory**: All platforms and executions connected
- **Automatic Context**: Relevant history injected into new tasks
- **Relationship Tracking**: Links people, platforms, and conversations across time
- **Smart Continuity**: Never duplicates outreach or loses context

<Note>
**Example in Action:**
- January: Agent messages John Smith on LinkedIn
- March: Agent starts email campaign
- Result: Automatically knows John was already contacted, references prior conversation
</Note>

This combination of persistent memory and historical context means agents get smarter over time, understanding your business and relationships better with each interaction.

### History: Audit Log

<Card>

<Frame>
  <img src="/actionist/images/history.png" alt="Actionist History" />
</Frame>

**Complete visibility and control over every automation**

Track, review, and audit everything your agents do:

- **Video Playback**: Watch full screen recordings of any execution
- **Action Logs**: Every click, type, and decision documented with timestamps
- **Error Tracking**: Identify exactly when and why automations fail
- **Compliance Records**: Maintain audit trails for regulatory requirements
- **Performance Analytics**: Measure execution times and optimize workflows
- **Execution History**: Browse all past runs with filters and search

<Info>
**Pro Tip**: Use History's video playback to debug workflows, train new team members, or demonstrate compliance to auditors. Every action is recorded and can be reviewed at any time.

## How Actionist Works

### The Action Loop: Brain of Your Digital Employee

At the core of Actionist is the **Action Loop**, a continuous cycle of observation, decision, and action that mirrors human computer interaction. By looking at the screen, it can understand the context of what is happening, using the LAM (Large Action Model) to decide what Action to take next.



### How the Action Loop Works

<Steps>
<Step title="Observe">

The LAM captures the current screen state, understanding what's visible just like a human would

</Step>

<Step title="Decide">

Using the Action Tree's millions of mapped journeys, it determines the optimal next action

</Step>

<Step title="Act">

Executes the precise GUI action, clicking, typing, scrolling, or navigating

</Step>

<Step title="Verify">

Confirms the action's result and determines if the goal is achieved or more steps are needed

</Step>
</Steps>

This Action Loop happens on repeat, taking one Action at a time, until either:
- The AI determines that the goal has been reached
- The time allotment has been reached (see [Agent Calendar](/actionist/agent-calendar-schedules))
- The workflow initiates a different workflow

<Frame>
  <img src="/tokenomics/images/ActionLoop.png" alt="Action Loop Diagram" />
</Frame>

### LAM API (Large Action Model)

The Actionist app uses the LAM API to utilize the Large Action Model and launch the Action Loop:
- Each of these Actions consumes the $LAM token as fuel, which is the central utility of the ecosystem
- The $LAM consumed during the Action Loop goes through a distribution and burning mechanism
- Read more here: [Token Utility](/tokenomics/token-utility)
