## Your AI Employee That Never Sleeps

Actionist is Action Model's flagship desktop applicationâ€”a revolutionary tool that gives you a **digital employee** capable of controlling your computer's mouse and keyboard to complete any task you can imagine.

While Big Tech wants to sell you chatbots that generate text, Actionist actually **does the work**. It doesn't just tell you how to book a flightâ€”it books it. It doesn't just explain social media strategyâ€”it executes it.

<Warning>

**The Game Changer**: Unlike traditional automation tools that break when websites update, Actionist is powered by the community-trained LAM that self-heals and improves with every user interaction.

</Warning>

## How Actionist Works

### The Action Loop: Brain of Your Digital Employee

At the core of Actionist is the **Action Loop**â€”a continuous cycle of observation, decision, and action that mirrors human computer interaction:

<Steps>
<Step title="Observe">

The LAM captures the current screen state, understanding what's visible just like a human would

</Step>

<Step title="Decide">

Using the Action Tree's millions of mapped journeys, it determines the optimal next action

</Step>

<Step title="Act">

Executes the precise GUI actionâ€”clicking, typing, scrolling, or navigating

</Step>

<Step title="Verify">

Confirms the action's result and determines if the goal is achieved or more steps are needed

</Step>
</Steps>

This loop continues until your task is complete, with each action consuming a small amount of $LAM tokens as fuelâ€”creating real utility for the ecosystem.

## The Power of Ownership

<Info>

**Critical Difference**: Every automation you run with Actionist consumes $LAM tokens. But unlike paying Big Tech for AI services, here you can **earn those tokens** by contributing to the ecosystem. You're not a customerâ€”you're an owner.

</Info>

### The Circular Economy

1. **Train the LAM** â†’ Earn $LAM tokens
2. **Use Actionist** â†’ Spend $LAM tokens  
3. **Create Workflows** â†’ Earn from others using them
4. **Grow the Network** â†’ Increase token value

This creates a sustainable economy where contributors benefit from the platform's growth, not distant shareholders.
