## The Second Brain for Your Digital Workforce

Agent Memory transforms your automations from simple task executors into **intelligent, context-aware digital employees** that remember everything about your business, preferences, and relationships between platforms.

Think of it as the difference between a temp worker who needs instructions for everything and a seasoned employee who knows your business inside out.

<Warning>

**The Game Changer**: Without memory, agents start from zero every time. With memory, they accumulate knowledge, learn preferences, and become exponentially more valuable over time—just like real employees.

</Warning>

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## How Memories Enhance Workflows

### From Basic to Brilliant Automation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Context Injection at Runtime" icon="syringe">

**Smart Memory Retrieval**

When a workflow executes, the system automatically:
1. Analyzes the current task and platform
2. Retrieves relevant memories from all categories
3. Injects context into the agent's decision-making
4. Prioritizes memories by relevance and recency
5. Updates execution strategy based on knowledge

**Impact**: Workflows become 10x more intelligent without any manual configuration

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Cross-Platform Intelligence" icon="share-nodes">

**Connected Knowledge Graph**

Memories create relationships between platforms:
- "Customer in Salesforce = @handle on Twitter"
- "Project Alpha in Asana = Folder X in Google Drive"
- "Invoice #1234 in QuickBooks = Contract ABC in DocuSign"
- "Lead from LinkedIn = Contact in HubSpot"

**Result**: Seamless automation across disconnected systems

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Learning from Experience" icon="graduation-cap">

**Continuous Improvement**

Every workflow execution can update memories:
- Successful patterns are reinforced
- Errors create new warning memories
- Optimizations are automatically noted
- User feedback becomes permanent knowledge

**Evolution**: Your agents get smarter with every task

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Personalization at Scale" icon="fingerprint">

**Unique Digital DNA**

Memories make each agent unique to your business:
- Industry-specific terminology
- Company-specific processes
- Personal communication style
- Custom platform configurations
- Unique workflow patterns

**Benefit**: No two agents are alike—yours is perfectly tailored

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Creating and Managing Memories

### Three Ways to Build Intelligence

<Steps>
<Step title="Manual Memory Entry">

**Direct Knowledge Input**

Add memories through the dashboard:
1. Navigate to Memory section
2. Choose category (General/Platform/Workflow)
3. Enter memory in natural language
4. Tag with relevant keywords
5. Set importance level (Low/Medium/High/Critical)

**Best for**: Core business knowledge, rules, and preferences

</Step>

<Step title="Background Learning">

**Automatic Knowledge Extraction**

Agent observes your work and creates memories:
- Detects repeated patterns
- Notes platform-specific behaviors
- Learns navigation preferences
- Captures decision criteria
- Records error resolutions

**Best for**: Platform functionality and personal preferences

</Step>

<Step title="Workflow-Generated">

**Dynamic Memory Creation**

Workflows can create memories during execution:
```yaml
IF new_client_onboarded:
  CREATE MEMORY: "Client {name} prefers {communication_method}"
  CATEGORY: "Client Preferences"
  IMPORTANCE: "High"
```

**Best for**: Dynamic, execution-based learning

</Step>
</Steps>
