## 1 Billion Jobs, Infinite Automation Possibilities

There are approximately **1 billion people** employed to work behind computers worldwide. Every single one of these jobs relies on just three tools:

1. **üëÅÔ∏è Looking at the screen**
2. **üñ±Ô∏è Using the mouse**  
3. **‚å®Ô∏è Using the keyboard**

AI can now utilize all three. The result? Computer agents like Actionist can perform **any computer-based work**, creating nearly infinite use cases.

<Warning>

**The Reality Check**: If your job involves a computer, Actionist can do it. The question isn't whether AI will automate your work‚Äîit's whether you'll own the AI that does it.
