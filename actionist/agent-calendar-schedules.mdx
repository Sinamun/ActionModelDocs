## Your Agents Have Calendars, Just Like Your Staff

In the traditional workplace, employees have calendars, schedules, and shifts. Your AI agents are no different‚Äîexcept they work **24/7 without breaks**, never call in sick, and execute with perfect consistency.

The Agent Calendar system transforms chaotic automation into **organized, predictable, scalable operations**.

<Warning>

**The Paradigm Shift**: Stop thinking of automations as one-off scripts. Start thinking of them as scheduled work performed by digital employees who need proper time management.

</Warning>

- **Error Cascading**: Downstream handling of upstream failures

**Example Chain:**
1. Daily Data Collection (6 AM)
2. ‚Üí Data Processing (After #1 completes)
3. ‚Üí Report Generation (After #2 completes)
4. ‚Üí Email Distribution (After #3 completes)
