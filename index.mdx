## The Revolution Has Begun

Action Model is building **the world's first community-owned Large Action Model (LAM)**—a groundbreaking AI technology that doesn't just understand and generate text like ChatGPT, but actually **performs actions** on computers just like humans do.

This isn't another chatbot. This is the future of work itself.

## From LLMs to LAMs: The Next Evolution

### The Limitation of Current AI

Today's AI landscape is dominated by Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. While impressive, they have a fundamental limitation:

<Info>

**LLMs can only generate text.** They can tell you HOW to do something, but they cannot actually DO it for you. They're brilliant advisors trapped behind a text box.

</Info>

### Enter the Large Action Model

Action Model represents the next evolutionary leap in AI technology:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="LLMs (Yesterday)">

- **Output**: Text, code, images
- **Interface**: Chat windows
- **Capability**: Advises and explains
- **Example**: "Here's how to book a flight..."
- **Limitation**: Cannot interact with websites or apps
- **Value**: Information and guidance

</Tab>
<Tab title="LAMs (Today)">

- **Output**: Actual completed tasks
- **Interface**: Direct GUI control
- **Capability**: Acts and executes
- **Example**: Actually books your flight
- **Power**: Controls mouse, keyboard, navigates apps
- **Value**: Work completed autonomously

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## How Action Model Works

### The Action Loop

At the core of Action Model is the **Action Loop**—a continuous cycle that enables AI to interact with any software interface:

<Steps>
<Step title="Observe">

The LAM captures the current state of the screen, understanding context through screenshots, DOM elements, and interface analysis

</Step>

<Step title="Decide">

Using the proprietary Action Tree, the model determines the next optimal action based on the goal and current context

</Step>

<Step title="Act">

The LAM executes the precise GUI action—clicking, typing, scrolling, or navigating—just as a human would

</Step>

<Step title="Verify">

The system confirms the action's result and determines if the goal is achieved or if more actions are needed

</Step>
</Steps>

This loop continues until the task is complete, creating truly autonomous digital workers.

## The Three Pillars of Action Model

### 1. The Browser Extension: Train the LAM

<Frame caption="Browser extension collecting training data to build the Action Tree">
<img src="/images/browser-extension-preview.png" alt="Action Model browser extension interface" />
</Frame>

Users install a browser extension that captures their web interactions, creating the training data needed to teach the LAM how to navigate the internet.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Passive Training" icon="circle-play">

Runs in background while you browse normally, earning tokens automatically

</Card>
<Card title="Active Training" icon="circle-dot">

Record specific workflows with higher rewards for quality labeled data

</Card>
</CardGroup>

### 2. The Desktop App: Your AI Employee

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 3. The $LAM Token: Your Stake in the Future

The $LAM token isn't just cryptocurrency—it's your ownership stake in the AI revolution.

<Note>

Every action performed by the LAM consumes $LAM tokens as fuel. This creates real utility and value for token holders, not just speculation.

</Note>

**Token Utility Breakdown:**

| Use Case | Description | Impact |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Action Fuel** | Every GUI action consumes $LAM | Creates constant demand |
| **Training Rewards** | Earn $LAM by contributing data | Incentivizes growth |
| **Marketplace Revenue** | Creators earn from their workflows | Builds ecosystem |
| **Governance Rights** | Vote on platform decisions | True ownership |
| **Burn Mechanism** | 34% of used tokens are burned | Deflationary pressure |

## The Proprietary Action Tree

### Mapping the Digital World

The **Action Tree** is Action Model's secret weapon—a vast, interconnected map of every possible action across the internet.

<Info>

Think of it as Google Maps for GUI interactions. Just as GPS knows every street and turn, the Action Tree knows every button, form, and workflow across thousands of websites and applications.

</Info>

**How the Action Tree Grows:**

1. **User Contributions**: Millions of recorded journeys from the community
2. **Path Mapping**: Each journey becomes a branch in the tree
3. **Intelligence Building**: Similar paths merge, creating robust workflows
4. **Continuous Learning**: New paths constantly expand capabilities

<Tip>

The more people train the LAM, the smarter it becomes. This network effect creates an insurmountable moat against competitors—even Big Tech.

</Tip>

## Why Community Ownership Matters

### The Problem with Big Tech AI

Current AI development follows a troubling pattern:

<Warning>

**You provide the data → Big Tech builds the AI → They profit → You get displaced**

This extractive model concentrates wealth and power in the hands of a few corporations while the contributors get nothing.

</Warning>

### The Action Model Difference

Action Model flips this model entirely:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Traditional AI" icon="building" color="#dc2626">

- Closed source development
- Corporate ownership
- Users as products
- Profits to shareholders
- No user participation in value

</Card>

<Card title="Action Model" icon="hand-holding-heart" color="#16a34a">

- Community-driven development
- Distributed ownership via $LAM
- Users as owners
- Profits to contributors
- Direct participation in value creation

</Card>
